review,classification
I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.,bad
This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale,bad
"I want to love this shirt, i really do, but it's huge! the top is tent-like, which would be adorable with skinny jeans, however the length of the back dips so low, the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful, more like a light grey heather, and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall, the top is cute, but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt, so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly, it's a return.",bad
"Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back. 

(i'm 5'6"", 135 pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.)",bad
,bad
Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.,bad
"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature",bad
"I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me.",bad
"I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.",bad
"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12.
the colors, the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.",bad
Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...,bad
"I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering, even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering, it's just odd. and the fit is super huge, you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute, but was executed so poorly.",bad
"I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!",bad
Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.,bad
This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.,bad
"I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back.",bad
I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.,bad
"I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen, in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover, the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.
overpriced, to boot.
obviously, mine is a minority opinion.",bad
"I really wanted to love these, i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well, they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return, so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.",bad
"I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived, i thought it was a cute, different top, uniquely designed. when i tried it on, it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately, it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect",bad
"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"", 115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th",bad
"I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit, they run really small, i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(",bad
"Like one of the previous reviewers, when my jacket arrived, it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic, medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally, know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy, but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs, but it was s",bad
,bad
The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.,bad
I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small. i could not even pull the skirt all the way up. returned,bad
"I recommend this dress because it is beautiful, stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big, lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.",bad
I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size,bad
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",bad
"I really wanted to love this waistcoat. i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received it.
it runs large, but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing. the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed, the hip area !!!!. i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs, but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size. it's going back, but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative !!!!!",bad
"This top looks so pretty on the model. however, the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted, so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller, this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c",bad
"Normally, hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out, the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra, you get to see the whole side of it. secondly, the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra, too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle",bad
"Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps",bad
"Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest, this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!",bad
"This sweater is very long, could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !",bad
I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.,bad
"I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps, but they did not feel or fit the same way at all. i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white. these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me. sadly, these will be going back.",bad
"I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out, there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why, sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!",bad
I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.,bad
"I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale, thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee",bad
"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical, fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all, and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic"", it would be difficult to",bad
"I saw this dress and loved everything about it! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big. they were out of the smaller size, so i had to return it. the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture.",bad
"Although i love the soft feel of the sweater, the zig zag design was very unflattering. also, the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.",bad
"The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16"" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11"" at the waist and 18"" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty.",bad
"I got this shirt in a medium, my normal retailer size and while the short fit, the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back, however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed, and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.",bad
"If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.
the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.",bad
"Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus, it's cream, not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.",bad
"I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn, and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans, or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!",bad
"I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays, the length, the material, etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad, i would have bought it for sure.",bad
"I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans. based on the other reviewer, i ordered one size up, and they fit perfectly. i'm 5'8 and appreciate the longer inseam. i can't wear a wedge heel or anything with them, but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly. you'll love the raw hemline and the subtle ""wear"" throughout the fabric. it's not overdone. just like in the picture, they really seem to narrow the hip, think page boy style. very, very flattering!",good
"This is a beautiful dress! i love the patterns, the beading and the texture. however, i have returned it (size medium - my usual size) and asked for an exchange up to a large (fingers crossed it will be available!) because the shoulders are very narrow. i am fairly tall (5'8"") with an athletic build. the body fit was a bit tighter than i expected also but not really an issue. however, the shoulders were obviously tight making it look too small and uncomfortable. yikes! i sooooo love this dress a",good
"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.",good
"This dress is really pretty and fun. i can see where i can dress it up or tone it down. subtle pretty beading at the neck. just ran a bit big on me, i sent back for the next size down -can't wait to get it!",good
"I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3), but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume., and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!",good
"Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)",good
"The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size, figure flattering, and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece, this is it!",good
"For a brand called ""tiny""--this dress was really big. i ordered my usual m and it was like a sack--virtually no shape to it at all. i haven't been a small in many decades, so i'm really hesitant to order it again. i'm afraid i'll be like goldilocks--""too big!"", ""too small!""--but i'm probably going to give it a whirl because the green print is so pretty, and i l like that it has sleeves to protect from sun. and pockets! lots of good qualities, just putting them together in a wearable size seems t",good
"I typically wear either a 2 or 4 and had to size up with this coat. the 6 fit, but i decided to go with an 8 to ensure it'd fit with layers. the sleeves aren't lined, so it's a little itchy against bare arms. it's really flattering and i love the pattern!",good
"Ordered the xsp (5'4"" about 118-120#, athletic build)...this was huge all over. big in the armholes, too much fabric hanging in the skirt (cream fabric) front and back, not flattering at all from the sides and as long on me as it shows on the model. i love the idea of this and for the right body type (of course) this will be beautiful. it also would not be a very versatile piece for me...the top sweater part is quite thick (lovely) and heavy. in oklahoma this would not work for very many weeks..",good
"I saw this top in my local store and almost didn't try it on solely because i hate split-sleeve/cold-shoulder tops. but, the peplum style and pattern were so cute that i took it into the dressing room anyway. after trying on probably 6-8 items, i wound up buying this top and one other. i really like the fit, as i am high-waisted, and it defines my waist really well . the wide neck is also super flattering. and i love the pattern. i went ahead and purchased, despite the fact that i wasn't thrille",good
This is a great dress!  very different and light but cute details,good
Blue jeans that fit like a dream & they were on sale.,good
This is a great shirt. the ruffles are strategically placed and hide any stomach flaws. i get that others are surprised by the arm slits but a couple of well placed stitches will make it very work appropriate or if you're worried about arm waggle. the color borders on black/navy,good
"Best jeans ever! it's so hard to find a good petite jean. you shop and shiop and then pay $30 more to get them altered. the fit and length on these are perfect. love, love, love!!!",good
"Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.",good
"Nicer twist on the casual tshirt. soft, comfy. love the purple.",good
Love the tee but it is very thin. best for layering,good
"I really love these leggings. the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting. quality is great. i am 5 1"" and 125lbs. the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option. but still would not hesitate to buy again!! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors,...that's how happy i am with this purchase!",good
"I followed the other reviewers who said these fit true to size. i have to disagree. i normally wear an 8 in shorts, which is what i ordered, and the fit is too tight in the waist and butt. i'm exchanging for 10. i really like the color and fun accents. i really hope i can get these in 10!",good
"I really like the style of this top, the open sleeves are subtle. i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment. it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small, but my usual medium worked for me. i am a solid 8.",good
"I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!",good
This sweater is absolutely beautiful. the shape is very flattering both tied in front and in back. the wool is nice and soft and the color is a nice neutral that will pair well with anything. the stitching is a nice added detail that makes this sweater somethig special. it is a great addition to any wardrobe and i'm thrilled that it is part of mine. i can't wait to wear it!,good
I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!,good
"Beautiful, comfortable and attractive sweater! my neckline doesn't stay flat as the one in the photo does, but i love the sweater anyway. great quality, attractive, and comfortable.",good
"Well-made, gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person, which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs, etc.) 
you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.",good
"This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well, too, and during cooler seasons, i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.

the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.

as a whole, this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material",good
Im size 16 top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back...,good
"It's a phenomenal wardrobe peice. quality, comfort, versatile. dress it up or down, belt it or not, boots or shoes. i'm 5'3"", 115ish lbs, small fit my 34d chest beautifully. a great buy - have fun with it!",good
Very comfortable. im 5'2 so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length. no need to roll up. slightly slim fit but not overly tight. typically order everything online and didn't need to return. ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded black/dark grey.,good
"I love love love this top. i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often. i think it's feminine, chic, and classic. i've worn it several times and i each time i've had more than one person comment on it. i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large. the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves. i usually just unbutton those anyway so no",good
I love these pants and wear them all the time. i wish they hadn't been discontinued,good
"This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review. i love it. the neckline is perfection. the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms. i found it a bit see through, and added a white cami.

sizing: i ordered an xs. normally i wear a small in retailer brands, and a med in most other brands. size small t's have been too large lately. i'm 5'5"" tall, 135 lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, long torso, narrow across the shoulders, and short arms. 

fit: loose fitting t's l",good
"This dress is perfect for the summer, very lightweight, has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting, so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6"" tall, but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly.",good
"I love the colors and pattern on this dress, and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however, i'm pretty small up top, and the neckline comes pretty low, so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra, or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet, but will keep the dress for sure.",good
"I adore this dress! it's so charming. great quality, lovely fabric, beautiful color. the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably won't work on a beautiful curvy body. with a petite athletic body, i feel beautiful in it! i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small. pair it with black or camel, sandals or boots, it's lovely!",good
"I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall",good
"Let me talk about the fit. i am a size 6 petite. i weigh 120 and am 5' tall. i am curvy and have short legs. what little height i have is in my torso. that being said, i ordered the 6p and the 6. no doubt about it! the 6p fits like a 4p. the 6p was tight in the hips and thighs. the size 6 regular was a perfect fit. if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite. so i would have ordered a 8p i'd i wanted the cropped look like in the pic. bu",good
"The lilac pic of this shirt doesn't do it justice......it is so darn cute on! the band around the waist really draws your eye in and makes your waist look really small.... love that!!! also, the pleated sleeves are just so feminine and pretty! the fabric is like a washed cotton.....very soft. i can see this being dressed up or made really casual.....i bought the green color and am going to wear it with a chunky turquoise necklace and pencil skirt!",good
"I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway. so glad i did. the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy. i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey. it is just so different yet such a nice neutral. i am normally a size 10 (or maybe a large 8) in tops and purchased this in size 6. it definitely runs large. for reference i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. not sure why another reviewer said this top isn't for large busts. it was very flattering on me an",good
This is perfection in the color sky. get you one now. you will not regret it. it is super soft and flattering!,good
"I received this dress today and can not be happier. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the 2 fits perfectly, hitting about 1.5"" above my knees. the print is so pretty and elegant. the colors aren't too vibrant, aren't too muted. the collar and french cuffs give the dress an extra flair. it comes with a little slip because the dress is sheer. i just tried it on with suede booties and it looks adorable! i'm ready for cooler temps to arrive so i can wear it!",good
"Bought the aqua because sizes were sold out. the bright color will be a welcome change this winter among all my neutrals. it's lovely, soft, well-fitting, and i only hope we have a few days in the south so i can wear it. well worth the price. would be a lovely wardrobe addition for any age, changed by what it's worn with...shoes, accessories,",good
These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/2 of an inch shorter than i would like.,good
"I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!",good
"I love this top! the color is quite unique (a reddish color), but the cut really makes it stand out. i love the square neckline. i feel it accentuates my bust without showing too must breast. i notice a number of other reviewers had an issue with the tightness around the bust: this top looks like it would have ample stretch in the photograph; however, in person you can see that the embroidered area does not have any stretch. for me, this was not an issue, as the top suited my body type well rega",good
"I don't understand the negative review
on this sweater. it is nothing short of stunning. the quality and design are absolutely beautiful! and i love the lined pockets! i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever part with it - this is a sweater you hang onto forever. i will say it runs a bit large. i ordered the xs/sm and if i didn't know better i would think its m/l. either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online, do it! it is worth every penny, especially for the s",good
"I love this shirt! it's gorgeous! got it last night, wore it today, and received compliments all day long.

i don't normally look good in tunic length tops, but somehow there's magic in this one. the seaming on the front totally hides my post-baby pooch. too bad the baby just turned 3 and my pooch isn't going anywhere ...!

adore.",good
"Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/2 and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 25 in waist.",good
"This sweater is really pretty (and soft!) in real life, but if you purchase the coral color, be ready for a little bit of a surprise when you open the package. while it looks more orange and subdued online, it's more like a hot pink coral in real life. definitely more pink than orange and far more vibrant than pictured. still pretty, but not necessarily my taste so still deciding if it will go back or not. the cut and fit of the sweater is wonderful, though. it's so soft and airy, but definitely",good

"I've worn this twice now. the first time was after trying it on and realizing it was perfect. immediately purchased and never took it off. the second time, wore it to my internship (office) followed by museum and a concert. incredibly versatile. constant compliments. 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34 c, 27/28 waist. meant to be loose, carefree, incredibly modern. does wrinkle after long periods of sitting, but not enough to dislike. the biggest complaint for me and my retailer coworkers is that it is an incred",good

This blazer is gorgeous. the brocade fabric is beautiful. the color is really a blueish purple/indigo. you can wear it with a black skirt/pants and even jeans. the only downside is that it runs about one size smaller than what it says it is.,good
If you are looking for the perfect t-shirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you. it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together. i am just waiting for more colors to come out. i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt.,good
Love how this fits. length is great so i didn't need to hem (you wouldn't be able to). flattering on muscular/athletic legs/bottom. i bought in navy and then had to buy it in another color it fit so well.,good

Beautiful shirt. the color is more navy than pictured. the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture. my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem.,good
This is a cute top but a little pricey for cotton t shirt material. the arms and shoulders/armpit feel a little tight but is loose and flowy below the bust. it is not as dressy in person as it appears in the photos. a cute top for jeans or leggings as the length falls below the hip.,good

Great colors and not too voluminous. lined whig will be great for fall but the downsides are the huge elastic waist bc it'll require a belt or something over it (looks v casual alone) and even with a perfect fit it gives a bit of muffin just bc it's a huge piece of elastic. i've literally tried this on on two occasions trying to convince myself it it. lol but it's not worth it at the current price.,neutral

"I own the essential slims and love them, so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t",neutral
"I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material, but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.",neutral
This would be perfect except for the ridiculous attached scarf. the material is so soft and luxe. the colors are richer in person and perfectly go with everything. but the attached scarf ruins everything!! the scarf is not flattering and takes away form the cute buttons on the front. if the scarf could be removed it would be a great sweater coat. so disappointing.,neutral
"I'm 5'2"", weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return.",neutral
These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.,neutral

 Room was extremely small The road outside of the hotel was perpetually lined with honking traffic it was so hard for the uber driver to stop and pick passengers up The hotel also does not serve breakfast Lastly the hotel does not even have the facilities to store our luggage for 2 nights while we sightsee in paris even though we have booked for the subsequent 5 nights in the deluxe suite In the end the options they gave was 1 Ask my pregnant wife to lug the luggage to the train station to store it there 2 Find another hotel I cancelled the remaining nights and found a more reputable one that stored our luggage  The staff were polite enough Hotel looks new ,bad

 honestly it dosnt worth to say it is 5 star hotel as i travel a lot and always stay in 5 star hotels and comparing to others this property absolutely dosnt worth 4 stars the housekeeping cleaners start from early morning closing doors and opening doors aggressively that make noise at the corridor without caring that some people are still sleeping secondly they knock the door once or twice and they enter the room without permission in addition 3 nights i am calling the room service late night and they never pickup and i end with the reception answering me and i ordered through them moreover at the day of check out at 9 30 am we have received a call from the reception saying that your check out today yes i know that my check out is today but why do they call me early morning so i woke up thirsty and tried to open the fridge and it was locked because i am checking out today but still it is 9 30 am we have till noon i called the housekeeping to get me some water because they didn t put the night before bottles when they cleaned the room and the housekeeping answered me with full confident we don t have water we distribute after 6 00 pm is this a service we get in a 5 star hotel finally at 11 00am the girl from reception called me to say that you are checking out today and i am trying to withdraw from the card but it dosnt authorize i dont know who authorized her to take from my card and the bill was full of mistakes when i went down and reviewed my bill this is absolutely not normal for a 5 star hotel and i dont understand why is the price for rooms are so high and the service is too bad it is not insulting to your staff but really this property should train their staff up to the standards of 5 star hotels staff should serve the guests  i have upgraded to a room that has balcony and the room was fair in size,bad

 The room was not clean the bathroom was really dirty so that we needed to tell the staff to clean the bathroom to take a shower which was really not clean in the end The rooms looking at the garden were dark the ones on the road side were really noisy The hotel was with 4 stars which in my opinion not even close to 2 stars You can think of the hotel as a hostel  There is a tram line in front of the hotel but travelling in milano is easy for other parts as well nothing special for this hotel ,bad
 well i booked a room with a bath online and after a really tired day out when i went to my room there was only a shower and not very clean either also i asked to have a room with a bath and was told there was none left not true as the hotel was half empty that night also when i called reception and asked for a charger for just half an hour i was told there would be a charge of 5 pounds plus 20 deposit ludicrous as i paid a lot to stay there i then later found out that there where free chargers in the bar why wernt we told this it was really bad service and lack of knowledge of staff not knowing whats available and zero customer service i would hope to have my money refunded back in full as i do not warrant the stay a very pleasant one  only the location which wasnt the best either ,bad
 Everything Extremely run down rooms windows that don t lock but are easy to open with one finger I didn t like the fact that they charged me 10 hour for my room that was already ready A strange man entered my room with a key whole I was sleeping and the hotel had no explanation but that I should think nothing of it I was nervous to sleep both nights I was there To top it off the front desk man had horrendous body odour I will never go back  The lobby ,bad

 Everything Nothing,bad
 Everything The staff are arrogant and not helpful Not clean The floors are dirty the bathroom is always full of water Cleaners don t change dirty bed blankets pillows linens The wifi is crappy slow and keeps disconnecting You won t sleep at night due to the drunk noisy guys outside the hotel Whatever you ask the staff about the hot spots in Barcelona they will answer you using their restaurant and bar but not to go outside the hotel  Just the space of the room but nothing ealse,bad

 The room given No 504 is certainly dose NOT have the standard of an Executive Deluxe Room as defined by your hotel reservation and marketing department What was worse the window in this Executive Deluxe Room was over looking into a Utility Shaft not bigger than 2 5m by 2 5m This is really scandalous and shameful Finally The next day I have to check out and moved into another HotelNo Positive,bad
 I booked a basic double and got a 7 2 sqm dirty stinking prison cabinet broken bed could only be entered by crawling over the foot end Unsafe exit automatic doors didn t open 25 minutes for check in When I returned to ask for the double room as booked they just said take it or leave it but you will have to pay anyway Ergo Do not go there fraud and unsafe No Positive,bad
 This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day  Absolutely nothing ,bad

No Negative Very good,bad
 On arrival staff asked how I booked the room and seemed disappointed by me using booking com Suggested that I use their site instead and rather insisted on that to an annoying extent Also I felt uncomfortable as I had to give 10 pounds in advance so in case I did any phone calls using the room line the cost would be covered by that amount I really don t understand why I had to do that since I wasn t planning to do any extra costs and if so I could easily pay for that on departure On the top of that the room was ridiculously small so the photos of it are definitely misleading Not to mention that it was on the first floor with a view of the inner walls although I chose a room in the upper floors when I booked There are also other funny stuff going on like for example the toilet seat wasn t even customised on the toilet I would definitely not go back or recommend anyone staying there  Rather fair location,bad

 The whole experience from check in to check out was a disaster We arrived on out business trip to be greeted by construction at the reception area There was no one at the desk to check us in We needed to find one of the cleaning staff after 15 mins to alert reception that customers were had arrived Once the receptionist arrived he was extremely rude We were told that the dining room was closed and breakfast would be delivered to the room the next day Not a major issue there we thought When we mentioned that we were surprised by the level of construction and the effect this had on the overall quality of the hotel experience we were met with an unbelievable answer He informed us that because we had booked through booking com he mentioned it was our prerogative to inform booking com of the construction and not the hotels This is ridiculous We were told to come back later as he could not check us in at 13 00 so grudgingly we left our bags and went to work The rooms were basic enough the morning s breakfast did not arrive We checked out at 8am and three other guests were complaining that breakfast had not arrived in their room either The same arrogant attitude was present from a different member of staff All in all this was a terrible stay from start to finish We were there for only one night but I would advise everyone to seek alternative arrangements in the Kensington area Best Western is a recognised name in the UK hospitality industry this is one of the worst experiences I have had in many years of business travel Staff 0 10 Experience 0 10 Value for money at 198 per room 0 10 Do not stay here  Nothing ,bad

 Decor old and tired Too noisy Lifts didn t work properly which was not good when your room is on 11th Had to pay extra to use pool which had no seating area and a spa pool which didn t have proper access  Useful location for where we needed to be ,bad
 The hotel operated with only one staff member with very poor receptions and rooms Nothing,bad
 Rooms much to small Elevator extra slow and small Receptionist remained talking with a friend for about 7 8mn before daring talking to me while I was Just checking in Not acceptable Does not deserve 4  Location ok not too far from Montparnasse station ,bad
 Everything But I like the staff only Nothing it is overrated Four stars is too much One star is enough maybe ,bad
 Let s start with good things employee are friendly and kind but that should be normal for that kind of hotel so nothing new and wow hotel is clean and it is placed on good location rooms so called deluxe are extremely small Bathroom is even smaller toilet is placed inside bathroom and if you have more than 90kg and 1 80cm you are in great problems Lights in room are for decoration But greater problem is if you are women and decide to put make up in bathroom lighting doesn t exist A C exist but doesn t work It s not worth money and stars they haveNo Positive,bad
 Even after insisting on a room change after the so called superior double transpired to be no more than a shoe box we were allocated a club room in the basement with a view of a wall no daylight The room was cramped and small and the bathroom was no bigger than a toilet cubicle with a tiny shower enclosure Even the sink in the bathroom was so tiny that you could not have used it to wash in  Close to Queensway tube station,bad
 No wifi in room Had to use freezing communal area to access wifi No Positive,bad
 I got money stolen from my room Woken up every morning at 6am by noisy staff room which was located next to our room Not a lot,bad
 Room in terrible conditionNo Positive,bad
 After the hotel tried 4 times to pre authorize the room we got a room for people with special needs due to over booking in the hotel the staff was unable to provide other options the room was really not more 8sqm2 including the bathroom which was equipped for guests with handicap this was really terrible for people above 185cm like me I don t recommend that hotel  The location,bad
 Customer service is atrocious It seems that their motto has become the customer is never right I will never return to this hotelNo Positive,bad
 everythingNo Positive,bad
 Felt rushed at check in and didn t get any advice on transport or attractions Room wasn t serviced after the 1st night No bar service available at bar Shops restaurants were all Turkish near the hotel I d advise to pay a bit more and stay central  Shower good Bed comfortable ,bad
 Everything horrible place Nothing was dirty old fashioned and just vile,bad
 Bad Smell in the Bathrooms Room Service very long and forgot our order Curtains broke Phones not working All the services offered are Very Expensive No Positive,bad
 The front desk person was extremely unprofessional and dishonest I Was charged on my credit card although I had paid cash and repeated several time I did not want to have my card charged I Was promised by him that it will be credited it back on my credit card but I just received my monthly bill with the amount on it I now have to follow it up with my bank and go through the nuisance of proving it all Very disappointing and unethical customer service No Positive,bad
 The room was unclean noisy and smelt  Location,bad
 The room was not as expected and the furniture seemed very used plus the bed not so comfy and sheets were clean but they seem like used for years so I had to use my jacket to cover while sleeping Staff at reception were fine and friendly even the ones at the entrance were helpful Location was great and close to shops by oxfords street ,bad
 Room was too small for 3 of us Nowhere to put anything and the bathroom was far too small The carpet was dirty the sink in the bathroom was cracked and dirty as was the furniture No sockets by the beds leading to trip hazards The room was too warm and although we were on the 5th floor we could smell cigarette smoke Would not stay here again No Positive,bad
 The hotel made assumption for check out without notice Make my room unavailable No Positive,bad
 In the basement poor light right below reception so could here everything noisey all night never slept both days there plus waitress at breakfast was very rude Not much,bad
 Cxxl Nothing,bad
 No window room too hot no air conditioning No Positive,bad
 It was dirty The water in the jacuzzi was dirty so they don t clean the jets properly The beds were not made neatly and floor wasn t cleaned properly Main staff were rude and abrupt  It was spacious The pastries were nice,bad
 Very Noisy neighbours thin walls grumpy bar staff Bar shut at 12 midnight on Saturday Could and should be cleaner needs a bit of an uplift  The breakfast Close to las Ramblas ,bad
 The room was very noisy with building work going on next door which no apologies were made also we could hear the people in the gym next door the telly didn t work the coffee machine was broken we asked for a kettle which was extremely dangers as the plug didn t detached and burnt ourselves on several occasions trying to unplug it the bath was very old and stained and thats what we had paid a lot more for and again dangerous even to fill it as the plug was positioned over the far side of the bath THE staff were not very helpful waited over half hour for a drink at the bar never went again Breakfast was not very inviting cold eggs and coffee bland never went again got better quality and service on the rambles  The location,bad
 Swimming pool area and changing rooms filthy appalling service in restaurant mediocre food and beds like trampolines to sleep on Certainly not a 4 star hotel and Holiday Inn Expresses are better and much cheaper  Not much ,bad
 Dark Dingy Outdated Cold reception area Unsafe  Nothing ,bad
 Very dirty old room bathroom Nothing,bad
 Cost for room size shocking noisy air con in rooms Exec lounge is a waste of time breakfast was cold and no range of foods  The sky lounge but highly over priced,bad
 Staff Check in Check out  Happy Hours,bad
 everything staff were unhelpful I had my belongings stolen and they were unhelpful would not go back rooms are so so small and I PAID for an upgrade I asked for a quiet room but got quite the opposite I would NEVER stay here again I will stick to the grane in st pauls  bed was comfortable but that s it ,bad
 I was taken aback by the size of the room I have seen larger cupboards The room itself was shabby and the shower room toilet was impossibly small to share The bed was wedged into the room meaning there was no room to get out of bed on one side We had no time to complain or request a room change as the queues at reception on our way out were considerable Not a good experience at all The public areas of the hotel were ok but the room was not value for money at all No Positive,bad
 difficult to reach with public transport only one bus line The hotel looks worn out and run down Food in the local restaurant was really bad and expensive Breakfast was not included and WIFI cost 9 EUR for a day which works only for one device and sometimes the access code gets invalid and you have to ask the Reception for a new one All in all one of the worst hotels i have stayed in I can t fathom how they can have more than 2 stars  room was ok,bad
 Just a small window in the room No place for the luggageNo Positive,bad
 Everything Nothing,bad
 Cleanliness of room disgusting Decoration of room disgusting and falling off walls Hotel staff attitude terrible no help with changing room etc Nothing we liked experience was terrible,bad
 On arrival at the hotel it was apparent that the standard of hygiene was below that you would expect from the prices of the facility The corridors were smelling of tobacco where guests had clearly been smoking indoors When we got to the room myself and my wife were uncomfortable due to the lack of air conditioning The very old air conditioning in the room had a damp smell that was reminiscent of drainage system The poor climate control was further hampered by the window being screwed closed Breakfast was equally disappointing and the response from the staff was typical of the experience I would not stay in this hotel again and nor would I recommend it to friends No Positive,bad
 The false advertising of a single for a double to get me to click on the Lenorard hotel and I will not use Booking com in future which I have used for the last number of years  As I previously outlined refer to my booking ref I feel my treatment due to the false advertising of a single room for a double room was disgraceful,bad
 very small rooms 8m2 old hotel you can hear every noise from everywhere I could hear every noise from the next room elevator etc There is a railway very close so you can hear train all the time Terrible I went to reception to change the room but of course the only available room was more more expensive etc Would never go there again breakfast was solid ,bad
 Double bed 2 Beds Condition air not working Room too old to be suitable Wifi that was not working The staff know that the hotel is bad  Near Madeleine Centre of Paris,bad
 See above it was aweful The room faced the rear and overlooked a vent  The hotel was poor The room was tired the bathroom was aweful I cannot say a good word about the hotel It was so bad that we checked into the Hilton park lane ,bad
 Rude staff tiny rooms attempted to give us a twin room when we booked a double The pool is hilariously tiny  Decent location,bad
 Paying cash but being told another 100 was needed as a deposit Not a single member of staff could give an explanation for this Then on checking out had to argue the return of the 100 as know knew it had been taken NEVER EVER AGAIN plus the tills went down wifi does not work in the rooms try of food from room service left in the corridors hours terrible Leaving,bad
 Room very small no air conditioning bathroom very very small and cramped with no ventilation shower basic and very cramped room very warm uncomfortable if weather is warm with very little ventilation their is a room fan but just circulating warmth around very expensive for price of room The only thing good is location less than 10 min walk to subway car park,bad
 Air con in the room was rubbish didn t sleep well at all Generally wasn t clean toilet was filthy marks up doors Tried to have a nice drink outside by the bar but customers were shouting and making it very uncomfortable Did t get the warmth feeling you wish to have on arrival all very dull Lighting in the room was terrible room was situated outside the main street so couldn t open curtains  The style of the hotel was good Modern feel ,bad
 Everything Always a problem we checked in our room was wrong firstly then the second room was broke the heating wouldn t work or tv and they moved us again to a third room finally where they finally said is ok Nothing from start to finish was a disaster False advertising of hotel and rooms on your site ,bad
 I do not know too lazy breakfast waiter promptly clean upNo Positive,bad
 I just had a terrible experience at nh City Center in Amsterdam It is a pity its decay in service and comfort I had stayed there for a couple of times before less than ten years ago I decided to give it a new try from Nov 16 to 24 Bad idea The elegant old fashioned design is gone all over lobby and rooms It is all now in the same ugly formica style new decoration we find in any cheap hotel But nh City Center prouds itself to be a four stars It can be on paper In which concerns beauty and confort it is at most a three And in service forget about it The staff is arrogant or incompetent or both 1 Forget the promise of 35 m2 space and a room with a view We ve got a 25m2 if so and just one of the three windows facing a canal the others showed ugly roofs So if they give you the key to room 207 just say no 2 No cleaning in the first day before at least 3 PM even as asked with a signal in the door When I called the lobby attendant answered they had not finish the service yet No complaining No rush The cleaning by the way is lousy 3 Don t expect ponctuality at the delivery back of the laundry It was late of course without any info or excuses of course And I had to ask for it three times 4 One last thing to keep this short In the departure day beforehand in the morning I asked at the front office for a late check out to 1 PM just one hour later than the usual The girl in charge told me yes Of course the key has stopped working at noon and another girl from the front office call me at 12h35 PM to tell me the check out time was noon Of course I just picked up my luggage passed by the front office and took a cab to departure to never again stay or allow any friend or aquaintance to stay at nh City Center No Positive,bad
 Women who work on reception was unkind with us No Positive,bad
No Negative a disaster ,bad
 The room was disgustingly small and to pay around 190 for one night was daylight robbery I certainly would not stay there again  Not much really The breakfast was good but not worth 18 5 Euros ,bad

 The toilet overflowed which can happen to anyone but they did not deal with it in an effective manner I brought the problem to their attention at 11am as sewer was overflowing in the room and by 12midnight it was not addressed It was after midnight when we were given a new room The room was for three persons and the beds were only dressed for 2 They also provided no towels shocking experience When I spoke to the night manager he took no responsibility and blamed the day manager for not addressing the problem  Nothing this was a very poor experience,bad
 Rooms were very basic dusty bed was uncomfortable and pillows were very flat I suffer with bad back and contacted reception to ask for extra pillows Had to request them four times in all before they arrived at 1 30am  Location was very handy for museums and transport links,bad

 When I left I have problem about receipt I have sent several emails to ask for help but no response Even when I make several calls the employee hand up because of my poor englishNo Positive,bad
 Everything else Upon entering the building you might think you arrive at a prison although I have actually stayed in one at Helsinki that has been changed into a 5 star hotel this did not feel like a prison The receptionist is perhaps the prison warden who would not take a negative response The room I stayed is so small we have move like craps moving only sideways  The person serving breakfast,bad
 Parking Lifts Location confort,bad
 Air conditioning was so bad we have to open the windows and door for the room to cool down below 26 degree Celsius Would not stay there again over rated costs and service was very poor Made promises and did not commit on the air conditioning I stayed three and did not sleep with the windows opens and street noise No water on the second or third night Not a four star service Paying for the location not for the comfort or staffs ability to check us in One hour to Checkin 4 rooms That were booked in advance Bar open a little time Location that s it,bad
 Poor staff relations at reception and at breakfast Room dull dated floor not level particularly in bathroom Complimentary tea coffee making items not adequate nor replaced on second day Breakfast very basic eg basket of cold toast fresh fruit wrinkled and some showing rot Tea in a large thermos tasted of coffee Overall no value for money Sentiment shared by many guests We were very disappointed with our choice of this property for our last two nights of a wonderful 46 day UK holiday  Location to Paddington Railway Station Hyde Park,bad

 Too old and not clean at all No Positive,bad
 The room is SUPER TINY as compared to all neighborhood hotels whereby even offer cheaper price The breakfast has the SAME menu every single day throughout our 7 days stay The Housekeeper s cleaniliness quality is poor The Bathroom is so small yet the chair is freaking heavy to move around that tiny area There is no bottle opener for guest to enjoy our own purchased wine nor beer guest has to bring the bottle down to open worse facility than 1 star hotel  Free wifi location is great,bad
 The room was really old not matching at all with the common areas downstairs The bed was not comfortable at all Not a normally Hilton Hotel value for sure No Positive,bad
 Spider web in the room corners stained carpet dirty bathroom very uncomfortable bed no heating central heating wasn t working at all Single glazed window really noisy constant knocking noise all night from central heating pipes from other floors Damp smell moths in the corner of the carpets in the room power sockets are all damaged hot water only comes after running the taps for 3 4 minutes half used shampoo bottle left behind in the bathroom bedside lamp stands broken woken up by breakfast team noise than other guest noises at 7 30am Basement room lg2 should not be sold for money This was definitely a worth 85 a night hotel Next time I will spend that money to get a taxi home Very disappointing Felt ripped off  Towels clean and nice quality,bad
 It s run down needs to be totally refurbished and its dirty it s a disgrace maybe it was 4 10years ago but now it s 2 at best Booking com should not be selling it as 4 Hotel it s a disgrace to your company too if I could rate it lower I would  There is nothing about this hotel I liked,bad
 Rooms very old furniture dirty sheets and towels and bad equipments Bad reception not helpful Guest personal thing disappears I rate the hotel two stars hotel Nothing,bad
 Poor Internet connection Executive room was very Small This hotel is like a 3 starts hotel even less No Positive,bad

 Heater function was turned off yet the average temperature in Barcelona during our stay was still in the 50s When I informed the front desk they just issued us blankets Also the window in the room that we stayed at faces a wall it felt like a prison Cleaning staff also do not replace toiletries unless you ask them that is if you can find them All these for 260 average per day No Positive,bad
 I booked a cabinn The room was very very small the windows was broken and room temperature was around 12 degrees The room was so small and dark that everything seemed dirty Cracks in the sealing with discoloring around them Bathroom floor was ice cold I booked it for two days left after one with no refund of the second day but would not stay there a day more for obvious reasons So Please think twice before booking a cabinn and don t do it if the quality of the room matters to you  Breakfast was way above the low standard of the hotel ,bad
 I liked everything Pillows were especially comfortable,bad
 Poor value for money Atrocious bar facilities The overall cleanliness of the rooms was poor Staff were grumpy Beside flower market,bad
 The staff wasn t friendly at all Tried to charge us more than the Price given on Booking com The premium rooms are the size of a shoe box The toilet Kept running after flushing We left after just one Night No Positive,bad
 There are plenty stuff we didn t like about and here it follows 1 The staff has no clue about the services on how to respond to customer questions 2 For everything they contact the manager to get clarified 3 They speak terrible English 4 When asked about city tours and any other information regarding the city they simply ask you to contact the tourist info Yes Thank you I know that but you are locals or at least working in Amsterdam so get to know about your city and help your clients in providing basic info 5 Hired bunch of immature staff 6 Room was decent asked for queen size bed before hand while booking but they have joined two beds and made it look like one 7 Didnt even clean the trash it was left there when we entered I have traveled to so many countries and lived at places ranging from 3 star to 5 star The staff have always been the best and the rooms were very well kept worth the price untill i bumped in to this hotel Not worth your money total ripper I would never recommend to any of my friends and family to this hotel I would rather pay the same amount and try to live in the center Tip to management 1 Respect your customers 2 Provide proper training to your staff 3 Encourage to give away complimentary stuffs products for your customers for the high prices you charge for  Private parking is for free That s the only good grace Room was decent ,bad

 Upon arrival we were greeted and told we were too early to check in which we knew anyway We then didn t check in until 10pm as we were in the City all day We were given a room on the lower level which was below ground Our room was actually situated right next to the kitchen and restaurant which was very noisy at 7am the following morning As we were on the bottom level you could clearly hear the tube trains running underneath throughout the night Our bed was also a PULL OUT BED In a hotel which cost 166 for one night we slept in a PULL OUT BED Overall awful experience for a hotel that we were expecting to be extremely nice  Not a lot to be honest The locations is the best things shame about the hotel itself ,bad
 This is our second stay at hotel Ambassador and to the opposite of the first visit this stay was a horror We booked the same type of top floor apartment we stayed in last time and paid the same price for what was supposed to be a 44 square meter luxurious apartment with two floors and two big terraces but were shocked to be shown to a tiny room sitting area which could never be more than 30 meters with no balconies or even a view and had all sloped ceilings and walls that we banged our heads on whenever we moved When we complained to the receptionist she answered us with a stony face that I cant do anything to help you and will not refund you as your booking is non refundable When I asked to talk to the manager and explained that this is not what we paid full price for as it has nothing that is shown in the websites pictures she answered coldly that yes the description of the room on booking com is a little misleading Even when we asked them for simple things like cups or pans we were never even answered To cut it short our holiday was ruined by an utter disgrace of a room and the poker faced deceptive staff  Nothing at all ,bad
 There was hair in the shower and dirt when we first arrived in our room and bathroom light was broken asked reception to sort it out and a maitence man came up fixed the mirror but just got a towel and cleaned the shower and said don t worry about it We then ordered room service and I had sassuages and mash and my partner had the Halloumi salad all seemed well until I started eating the mash and there was a very long hair in it as you can guess not impressed and spoke to management imedeitley the Breakfast was a lot better in the morning  Cookies on arrival,bad

 This hotel would have been nice 30 years ago but has been in steady decline ever since The furnishings and rooms are dated and tired The staff unfriendly and unwilling Lack of attention to detail e g The back doors connecting to Paddington station were locked early in the morning meaning that guests had to walk out the front of the hotel and around to access the hotel This defeated the purpose of staying close to the station Overall disappointing and dissatisfying  Location very convenient if needing to travel on Heathrow Express to airport but not leaving too early in the morning ,bad
 The cost of food drinks seem to be higher than other places close by Facilities location of the hotel are excellent Staff are very helpful,good

 Quite cramped room but beds cosy and just enough space to work at needed to clear desk of kettle stuff to work Dated electrics extension lead for kettle tv lamp Very dark low wattage lights  Proper English style hotel A little fawlty towers I loved the homeliness and intimacy of it not big branded and brash Desk in room to work st wifi great Lovely staff felt secure and comfy after a day in the city Liked that it had a bath water pumping hot Breakfast ample not as cheap as on high street but worth the extra not to leave the building relax Short walk to Brompton road shops Harrods on doorstep of museums ,good
 Perhaps if I had to say anything negative it would be the size of the bathroom Rather small and hard to keep the shower water from not going everywhere in the bathroom I loved this hotel Its location and fabulous decore My room Was spacious with a fantastic view of the canals ,good

 The room 516 was based right next to he stairs and unfortunately it was extremely noisy  Always great staff,good
No Negative The bed and especially pillows were amazing The room was delightful and the pool in the basement was incredibly cool Our concierge Boris was extremely friendly and helpful and made getting tickets to various venues a breeze The nearest subway entrance is about a block away and really is the way to get around the city We were thinking about our next stay here before we even checked out ,good
 Wifi was not good need to come down to the sitting area to can use the internet By the way beautiful sitting area In the bathroom was missing beauty kit and shower cap No kettle  The most friendly staff from the receptionists to the barkeeper Breakfast was delicious you can experience all types of coffee made by professional machine Loved the cool orange fresh and cold gazpacho with extra virgin and fresh grounded pepper Metro is a 5 min walk away very close is located fruit shop small market and a bakery ,good
 The breakfast option was expensive as well as the hotel restaurant Grocery store was a 10 min walk Good option for cost savings  We loved the shuttle boat into central and Anne frank house Very convenient by metro Staff was always pleasent and helpful ,good
 Corridors a bit too dark and there was no one else in the restaurant around 10pm We would have been happy with a light meal in the bar but I don t think that was an option  Beds are unbelievably comfortable ,good
 Nothing in particular It was a pleasant stay Nothing in particular to be highlighted ,good
No Negative Centralised and close to Arch of De Triumph,good
 There were several interraptions of internet connection  Very nice locations Good breakfast Friendly staff Comfortable and very clean rooms ,good
No Negative Not much to add Amazing hotel and great location ,good
No Negative It s a great spot,good
 Late check out was unavailable to us but we were allowed to use the facilities throughout the day which was great  everything,good
 Having to pay gor car park Price should include parking as we were guests of the Hotel It is an extra cost and would be an extra incentive to chose the Hotel IF free parking was included We had a nice room but we were not told that it was directly over a Wedding Disco Maybe reserving the room for Wedding Guests would have been appropriate However this did not spoil our overall stay for the 3 days  Liked the location Staff and breakfast,good
 There was no sun umbrellas by poolside quite hot in city sun it would have been nice for each sun lounger to have an umbrella  The bedroom was perfect so clean Loved all the extra touches fold down bed cover every night with a chocolate fresh bottle of water every day fresh rose in bathroom cumfy bath robe and slippers friendly staff the best was been given a phone so you ve wifi everywhere you go in city COOL My stay was splendid and worth the price ,good
 Shower bath not user friendlyNo Positive,good
 Alhough the staff were always happy to provide hot drinks I would have liked tea and coffee making facilities in the room and also some slippers I don t know anyone these days who uses trouser presses perhaps the hotel could provide an iron and ironing board instead The building is quite old and creaky and one can hear a lot of noise from outside in the corridors and from adjoining rooms my room was downstairs in the basement next to a service room and I could hear the staff unlocking the door moving cleaning equipment about etc extremely clearly This didn t really bother me but it might be something that would affect noise sensitive people It s possible that the rooms on the top floor are quieter  The room was really well heated which is unusual for England especially in old buidings I greatly appreciated that It was also great to have a big wardrobe space and plenty of coathangers plus bathrobes and toiletries and complimentary water I liked the fact that the windows were able to be opened and that there were both slatted blinds and also thick curtains The bed was very comfortable I had booked a four poster room with nice crisp linen and good pillows plus I was happy to find a pure wool blanket in the wardrobe for one extra chilly night There were many different staff members on duty during my two day stay but all were friendly and personable 24 hour reception is always good to make one feel safe The location is excellent as Nevern Square is very quiet but it s only a few minues walk to the tube station ,good
 I would expect a bit more from a hotel of this price category i e bathrobe and coffe machine in a room or slightly bigger selection of meals for breakfast Insufficient wardrobe space I got feeling that I m paying for the style rather than the comfort AC unit was a bit noisy but on the other hand very efficient  Stylish hotel in a good location close to subway and many interesting places Interesting and funny decorations Friendly and helpful staff I was afraid of noise from the outside but windows proved to be soundproof Restaurant offers very tasty meals for reasonable price ,good
No Negative LOCATION IS VERY WELL CONNECTED TO CENTRAL STATION AND DAM SQUARE STAFF IS FRIENDLY SPEAK GOOD ENGLISH BREAKFAST HAS GOOD VARIETY ROOMS ARE SPACIOUS ,good

 No outside window Loved the location,good
No Negative This was a very modern and high tech hotel Very comfortable bed and easy access to Greenwich and London as well The staff restaurants and bars were excellent ,good

No Negative Very nice ,good
 N a Location for shopping museums and tube,good

 No alcohol allowed on premises but no mention of this on website booking sites Mini bar lit up the room at night Air con knocked off after 1 hour annoying at night Staff seemed disinterested when we arrived were made to wait for 15 minutes as room not ready  Very quiet Comfy beds tall people would struggle with the size though 5 mins walk from tube station Mini bar fairly priced Shower excellent ,good

No Negative Very good location Very welcoming The size of the room is just right and functional Excellent over all We ll come back again next time to Paris,good
 camere un po troppo piccole Design e top floor bar con splendida vista sullo Shard e la Torre Meritano una visita ,good
 Too warm in hotel Food room,good
No Negative Great having a kitchen Massive Super market just across the road Good to have a door seperating the main bed and sofa bed Really close to camp Nou which is why we were there 2 mins from the metro Good wifi Really clean Bit expensive but worth it for convenience Lots of places to eat out close by,good
 Rooms are small and the staircase area is too dim But I understand this is the general standard of hotels in Paris that rooms in old buildings are small  Location and the history ,good
 The surcharge for the mini fridge for a 300ml bottle of water of 2 75 is VERY EXCESSIVE How about two free bottles of water  The room and bathroom were impeccable clean and the free Wi Fi was stable ,good
No Negative The facilities were excellent The breakfast more than lived up to expectations If you are hesitant on the location don t be The train stop is a very short walk and is into the centre in five minutes The tickets are cheap and tge stop is easy to navigate Alternatively you can rent bikes Again an easy ride along a dedicated bike path for aboutin 15 mins The restaurant staff value and comfort of the hotel make the location worth the effort ,good
No Negative Stylisches Hotel ,good
 Parking was a bit expensive and the bar was way too small You can park down the road for 6 euros a day We used the park and ride on the U3 at Kendalstrasse which was easy and probably much less of a struggle than trying to get into the city centre  Nice rooms good location Very peaceful ,good
 Very similar to NYC good central locationNo Positive,good
 room is a little small the painting on the wall is scaring better to remove it water in the room charges money and there is no clear notice for it lovely hotel with stylish room and public area close to bus and metro stations easy to get around really nice staff good service downstairs public washroom provides us with great convenience clean and really thoughtful,good
No Negative Great location close to everything A modern hotel for people who wish to avoid old style hotels The breakfast was not included in the price and was quite expensive ,good
 Wouldn t change a thing about our stay  All the hotel staff were really welcoming and always greeted you with a smile and a hello The rooms were a good size and the bed very comfy Breakfast was really nice and a good selection of food available The hotel is right on the locks so you just walk out of the hotel and everything is there for you ,good
 Room was basic and needed an update Curtains would not pull together  Good choice of basic breakfast food Ok for a 1 night stay ,good
 restaurant food was very average a bit of a let down here as it actually lowered overall grade we got buy one get one free frappe coupon when we checked in Nice touch sure but as it was crazy hot we asked at restaurant if we could get anything cold instead coke ice tea whatever one waitress said that she does not know what that coupon is and that it says frappe the other one echoed the same but she called somebody and asked if we can get something else and the answer was no frappe means frappe In the meantime she made quite non friendly comment about our question in German language not knowing that I actually speak German approached both ladies in English so my wife knows what we are talking about Just to point out this lady basically ruined nice check in experience we had as much as room interior is indeed interesting and different the fully look through shower cabin in the middle of the room is quite controversial idea We found it just weird while I can imagine some people would not like it I think this should be mentioned at check in  staff was nice apart from two ladies in restaurant mentioned in not like section this is an original hotel meaning that they try to be different in design style and customer approach Mostly it works in plus however there are small disadvantages again look at not like section location close to main train station very close to Belvedere 20 25 minutes walking to city centre train to city centre just next to the hotel very interesting room interior really urban,good
 The free WiFi internet connection suffers with bad response time I needed to use my 4G roaming to access the internet from the room Maybe the management of the hotel should also supply each room with some socket adapters from EU to UK format because I had to buy my own adapters to charge my mobile phone  Quite good value for money hotel around this area Perfect position in the center of London and very close to Soho Visiting everything by foot The staff was very kind and willing to help I don t know about the food or breakfast because I didn t order but it seems to be good from what I saw The room was old but it was comfortable and seems to be clean They change towels and bathroom soaps everyday The room has nice view No problem with noise No problem with the beds ,good

No Negative Staff was very polite and extremely helpful Yazeem was very friendly and professional ,good

 I got used to grant the park plaza a straight 10 point grading until i got my first and single time where i needed something from reception staff which was 5 out of the ordinary i needed to leave 1 day before the end of my stay i requested that 3 days prior to the end dof my stay and the saga started 1 sir you have to talk to booking com we cant do anything for you 2 had you booked directly with us we may have been able to help 3 went to my app and there it said contact the property for changes your booking is in the past u cant change it the property will answer your mail within x days thats too late 4 went back to reception the next day was told that i was too late i should have told them before 5 said i told them before 6 ahhh sir you booked with booking com u should contact them 7 i showed them where the app says to contact the property 8 ahhh sir the booking com app is disfunctional Still we cant do anything for you we will charge you for the night you will not be staying with us Ummmm in other words we are unflexible ppl ummm not good I thought that would be easy since ive been in this hotel many times and i had the feeling they were flexible and would accomodate gladly a multi returning guest s rightful request As i thought naively Sooo disapointed by this But still i gave a fair rating that does not reflect how disgruntled i am Since other categories remain good not excellent any more  I have booked this property 3 to 4 times It has a steady good quality all around in principle but check below what i was surprised to face this time around ,good

 Our room was called a junior suite but was basically a bedroom with a second single bed stuffed in a niche right next to the large bed Fine for my mother daughter and I but lacking in privacy one might expect with a suite The public areas of the hotel seemed a bit worn While the location was central and convenient it lacked in charm Though very close to the Marias which is full of charm  the room was charming just like the pictures and had a great balcony The location was very central and convenient to trains walking to the marais the louvre ,good

 Staff not on par with the 4 stars Only one person on staff at the front desk and any given time Could not show us to our room or take our bags Desk staff somewhat helpful in making recommendations for dinner and current happenings but am surprised by the absence of a dedicated concierge Mind you they were never rude Just to busy to be of any great assistance  Room thoughtfully designed and appointed Most comfortable bed in our three weeks of traveling throughout France In room Nespresso a nice perk Modern furniture ,good
 All was great All the Hotel and the people in the reception are really professional at all,good
No Negative Clean room great location and good breakfast,good

 The only suggestion we would like to make Put a tussue spender in the rooms and may some more hooks to hang up the towels  The loacation is absolutely fantastic breakfast was excellent the Hotel offers a good comfort and the personell is really outstanding ,good
 The only thing I can fault is the lighting in our bathroom was a poor There was no light in the shower area making it quite dim  The reason for choosing to stay at this hotel was the location It was a surprise trip arranged for my husbands birthday with tickets for a Barcelona FC game Camp Nou was a ten minute walk away We crammed in as much sight seeing as we could and enjoyed every minute of our stay ,good
No Negative Big Appartments with kitchen and spacy bathroom Very clean and great deal for this price,good

No Negative The whole experience was greatly enhanced by all the staff,good
 Tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them I feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger The staff were so welcoming and the little touches in our room like the rose petals and electric candles by our bath made our stay extra special the pillows were a dream to sleep on ,good

No Negative First class hotel as always ,good
 Go and give it a try  Very friendly and good service ,good
No Negative Very nice rooms extra friendly staff and great use of facilities ,good
 The bed was slightly uncomfortable The size and spacious nature with an excellent location,good
 Without sounding tight my only suggestion would be to change the price of breakfast 29 for a breakfast is very steep  The staff were very attentive as I booked the bath butler service Gigi was very helpful from the moment we checked in assuring me when the room would be ready The room itself was very modern and had one of the best beds I have ever slept in the late check out of 14 00pm was even better ,good
 Old tv The last day we had to be gone real early and we arrived at breakfast at 6 30 No hot water for tea and we had to ask for the eggs and bacon at 6 50 We needed to leave by 7 In general the breakfast staff were wonderful helpful and friendly But they seemed run off their feet  Great price having booked 6 months previously Worried initially on arrival because of the busy road But double windows made it very doable Comfortable warm rooms as the weather became cold Most of the staff helpful and friendly Nicely appointed foyer ,good

 I got the room in a corner Location,good
 Hotel lobby dining area is good a little over priced on alcohol etc but to be expected Rooms could do with a makeover A little old fashioned and tired out however beds are very comfortable  Location of the hotel is fantastic within walking distance to majority of the main attractions with loads of shops dining to chose from Easy to get to from Stansted airport Express train to Liverpool st then central underground line for approx 4 stops ,good
 There happened to be a fruit basket in the room and reception rang to let me know it was not intended for me not so nice but that I could keep it very nice  A friendly and knowledgeable reception is particularly welcome after a long trip On learning that I had not requested a room at street level without a second thought reception immediately offered me another room upstairs When I asked for directions to a particular restaurant close by reception pointed me in the right direction without needing to search on line for the location Nothing beats friendly and well informed staff ,good
 parking is in a associate car park so you will need to walk up the street although it was discounted for the hotel for overnight at 15 its a good old trek to you room loooong corridors dont leave anything in your car or you will need your walking boots nice hotel clean and modern,good

 The room is small and the bed is small but clean and comfortable  The North Ealing Picadilly line station is a two minute walk and the Ealing Broadway Central line station is 5 or 10 minute walk so good location Nice pub around the corner Shops Restaurants within easy walking distance The desk clerk breakfast guys and cleaning staff are all pleasant ,good
 Small points two paper cups in room for tea coffee which meant reusing if you wanted another a proper cup would be nicer We were also awoken on our first night in the early hours by the fire alarm apparently somebody having a hot shower It was very chaotic and nobody took charge of communicating what was happening to us outside the hotel including families with cold frightened children We ended up going back inside to find out what was happening when it was evident there was no fire  Room comfortable and very clean Children really welcomed children s breakfast with entertainment and children s menu in the restaurant along with gift when they arrive Very friendly staff in restaurant Sabrina in particular Bar lobby area comfortable to sit and relax good not to have to spend all your time at hotel in your room Convenient to metro so easy to get around ,good

 Bathroom d cor a little tired but comfortable Great location for central London Good sized room ,good
 WiFi speed could be improved Hygene is comparable to other hotels in Milano in this price range but could be improved Some rooms don t have a 2 person bed but 1 bed only Not a problem if you re travelling alone but don t expect a large roomy room with a king sixe bed if you make a single person reservation There is limited parking space for taxi s in front of hotel so sometimes a bit dangerous to get out of the taxi  Rooms are not overly large but sufficient WiFi is free and a bit depending on which room you are in of normal speed No premium WiFi avail Hotel personel is very friendly efficient check in and check out Since the hotel doesn t use a digital key there is always 230V power in your room allowing you to charge devices while out of the room Easy walking distance if Duomo and central area of Milan Low noise levels in hotel ,good
No Negative Room was good and had enough hanging space for your clothes,good
 they need to have either powdered milk or bottled cold milk in the minibar for in room coffee  the renovated design interiors were lovely both the public areas such as the lounges restaurants and lobbies and more importantly the room everything worked and in the room all details were customizable e g air conditioning critical because of the heat wave lighting and shower bath huge plus they had 3 charging outlets for the 3 main types of voltages UK Euro US in case you forgot yours the staff were all super accommodating and worked as a team together it was great having a room on a high floor with terrace and highly recommend doing so if you can ,good

 So sorry we only planned two nights here  I love this place They are a big part of the reason we fell in love with Milan Coming in with jet lag it s quiet comfortable Need a good restaurant in a hurry They ve got it covered even make a reservation for you Awesome surprises A beautiful rooftop garden bar they make fabulous manhattans and breakfast included is dinomite everything you ever dreamed of for breakfast and more there were cheeses breads fresh fruits cappochinos more more more and PROSECCO Staff was so helpful and friendly Can t say enough ,good
 The air conditioning is not cold enough When it is busy breakfast time there is not enough staff to clear up the table and the services could be a bit abrupt then  The breakfast is superb The metro station is just outside the hotel with connection to lines to major sightseeing sites ,good
No Negative Nice and cozy hotel in a great central location Best part was the staff Especially Luka Marika were amazing ,good
 Shower was very small  Staff was helpful and rooms were very clean ,good
 The room was very warm and the air conditioning didn t really make a difference also the lack of enough natural light wasn t nice Staff kept knocking on the doors to do stuff before we had checked out which was annoying The staff on the desk were really lovely and upgraded us to a superior room with free sparkling wine as it was my partners 21st birthday The room was cosy and the bed very comfortable,good
No Negative I like as the best the umbrellas for the guests,good
 Nothing Size of omelettes a disgrace,good
 full airconditioned rooms with no chance to open a window or turn off AC i felt locked in toilet and shower are within the room which might be cool design wise but i hope it is only in single rooms if this would be a shared room with partner or friends it is well akward the tram no5 is in front of the hotel and should offer a direct connection to the amsterdam center but the ride is annoying often delayed overcrowded and it takes half an hour and more No wonder is everyone riding bike very clean Intelligent smart room design big bed friendly staff cool lobby to hang out and have a drink fast connection to the airport via amsterdam zuid and the trains,good

 20 minute wait to be seated for breakfast then had to queue again inside for quite a while for foodNo Positive,good
 Bigger hotels tend to always exclude smth from the regular package you usually get from any other hotels even b bs and then ask for extra money This one did not have breakfast included which was not a problem but why would you not add it from the very beginning To make the price look less Stupid moves for a great chain Plus the breakfast for 12 euros per person had little difference from smaller hotels Finally what ruined it for me the hot water was barely warm cannot understand how thats possible in a hilton hotel Was a disappointment for me this time sorry  Good quality free parking ,good

No Negative We love the location and atmosphere and the friendly bar The staff are always helpful and friendly,good
 Ground floor bar feels like you re drinking in the foyer it needs a few shrubs to separate it a bit  We paid a little extra for a balcony room which was excellent We wanted the view of the front street and accepted the noise if the window was open Some would prefer the quiet of a room facing the internal courtyard but not us A good breakfast spread A rooftop terrace where we ate paninis from down the street for lunch Only 1km from central station and right on top of Lima Metro ,good
 The restaurant was closed throughout our visit The rooms were clean and comfortable,good

 No room service staff were unhelpful and quite rude  Pool and roof top bar were nice,neutral
 The room that I was in it was on the ground floor and when the curtains were open everyone would walk past and see inside the room I really didn t like that at all The bathroom was quite small and the floor was freezing in there Also the car park was way too small as it took me such a long time to find a spot and park my car  I liked how comfy the bed was ,neutral
 The room i stay in need maintain I ask for iron and i waited for 3 hours and no body show Location was perfect Swimming pool was amazing,neutral

 There was no breakfast included The restaurant was closed  The room was very comfortable,neutral
 One staff member Lisa I think was extremely rude I booked a double room for my girlfriend and I We were told only twin rooms were available unless we could prove we booked a twin Seemed to be some problem with booking com not saying what we booked She should not be working in customer service The Spanish women at reception was polite and really nice No Positive,neutral
 price is so high for entire hotel location ,neutral
 In room menu Wifi,neutral
 Rooms were kind of small beds were rock hard didn t sleep well I asked for 2 beds and the room was supposed to be a double room The shower was hatd to get into I also asked for a room with a view and had a view of a brick building  The rooms were very clean ,neutral
 The huge price tag was definitely not worth it there were no facilities at the Hilton that wouldn t have been available at a Premier Inn or Travelodge as a chain which represents luxury stays I really do not believe I received a luxury stay there were no lamp shades on the lamp the bottom of the bathroom door was scuffed and needed a lick of paint the view from the room was awful over looking a block of flats and a lot of little things were lacking NOT what you expect when paying 200 per night for a stay Ridiculous and not impressed No Positive,neutral
 rooms are tiny and don t even have a desk outrageously expensive for what it is this hotel must have been awarded 2 stars for its location Where have the 4 stars hotels of my childhood disappeared  location bed and broadband,neutral

 Bed was uncomfortable room was very small could hardly walk between end of bed and side of room Staff were very pleasant and attentive It did have air conditioning which pleased my husband ,neutral
 The room was dirty The location,neutral
 All night I was up awake as I could hear people walking across the wooden floors above me which made me feel uncomfortable all night I was honestly up all night the worsts nights sleep I ve had in a very long time Because the room also faces the main road the curtains don t close properly which also made me feel discomfort and paranoid It s really not worth the money  The access of the Wifi was great ,neutral
 Rooms weren t clean with so much dusty I did not sleep Also initially we wer checked in and when we arrived to the room was a complete mess they changed us to another room  Location,neutral
 Even though it was a nice hotel it s not really suited for families with very small children The staff really did their best but both location and facilities were not optimal for baby s toddlers  Staff was very helpful and friendly ,neutral
 The day i got in had i booked directly with the hotel my rate would have been 155 I paid via booking com 220 n 258 for following day So i was really very dissatisfied that i did not get the best rate through booking com how can you make sure this doesn t happen to future bookings Now i am unsure i should use your services Secondly at that rate i expected at least a kettle in the room with tea bags and cups I had to call up for one Thirdly one part of the cupboard was very dusty and obviously missed every time it was vacumned and cleaned I didn t bother telling the staff since it would mean me waiting for them to come up  I love the warm interiors and the concierge guys ,neutral
 The only search parameter I used to find a hotel in Amsterdam was Free WiFi It did not work at the hotel at all So out I go to buy an ethernet adapter to connect to the ethernet outlet in my room Which did not work The hotel all in all is ok but it s year 2017 the WiFi has to work No Positive,neutral
 The facilities are not quite up to standard and are old similar to most Holiday Inns Definitely not good value for money Breakfast was good One staff member was exceptionally good,neutral
 the bathroom was small the maids kept taking my extra towels i asked for every morning signing people in like i was in a college dorm proved to be insulting seeing how i have lodged at 4 star hotels or higher without that hassle getting in and out of the building at early mornings depended on an attendant being at the desk it was like i was visiting someone in prison I didn t get a good gist of the kitchen and it s possibilities the snack bar was a joke the room lighting options were something out of a whore house  the breakfast was probably the best part the internet connection was strong,neutral
 I do not like the idea of putting a shower cabin and a toilet unit too close to the bed Because of that the room feels very cramped Too much plastic A bit minimalistic to me Staff was friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable,neutral
 The bed The location,neutral
 All except bedroom too cramped for 2 people No Positive,neutral
 Very far from the center Uncomfortable bed Expensive parking Poor breakfastst Not worth 200 per night Clean and nice room,neutral
 The hotel cannot be classified as a 4 star hotel in my opinion Breakfast is served in the hotel entry way and the space is rather crammed the food was not bad but little varied When we entered the room they gave us it was quite a surprise when we realised the room was already occupied since there was luggage in it I find this unacceptable The rooms is too small and simple for the hotel s 4 classification  Close to the city center ,neutral
 Water very slow to drain from shower Lots of noise early morning from top floor No Positive,neutral
 Booked through booking com our original room offered looked nothing like the one shown nor the hotels website I think the hotel was not worth the 100 as we had problems with the room as the heating was not working and had to call for assistance serveral times until moving rooms  Location was good as it was close to Euston station The staff were kind enough to offer complimentary breakfast and willing to change our room twice when we weren t happy as had problems with heating We were also given a 10 discount,neutral
 The bed and pillows were so hard I had a sniff neck after 1 night and we had to ask for soft pillows because of this The bed was so hard that after a few nights of sleeping in them we have back ache for several days after with my partner having severe back pain The shower cubicle was very small and only a slim person could comfortably stand in and it also leaked on to the floor despite the doors being closed so the floor because very wet The bed was a standard double despite our room being upgraded from a standard double to a club suite FURTHER MORE we were woken up every morning at 6 30 onwards and could not get to sleep earlier that midnight due to constant noise of trampling and doors slamming above and around us so much that our room rattled When I advised the staff upon checkout of our experience they didn t offer a refund and have lacked compassion and professionalism by consistently not calling me back or calling to discuss the matter further when an specific time and day had been agreed for them to call me I am still waiting for a call I will not choose to book this hotel or other hotels by the same company again as they have been less than helpful and very reluctant to make contact with me now they have been paid my money in advance Absolutely disgusted  The service on check in was great with complimentary fruit and drink in the room ,neutral
 It is over priced  The location,neutral
 ROOM TEMPERATURE AC OUT OF ORDER LOCATION,neutral
 price food couldnt find correct light switch toiletries provided minimal despite having an exp room The room waa standard bht i thought the price per night was high,neutral
 We complained about three things and all were not resolved The TV in one of our rooms was not working properly to connect playstation to it We complained but the TV was never fixed The AC in my room could not go below 23 degrees which was bit warm for me They had to give me a fan because they could not fix it Pillow cases in my room were never changed during our stay although two of them got stained on the first day No one was there to help us with our bags to or from the rooms  The staff was friendly,neutral
 All the rest quite a disaster pillow with stains in the room No minibar for a Euro 336 rate per night that came as a surprise No room service No possibility to purchase any food in the late evening rather inconvenient for somebody staying there to attend a concert at the Arena  Location perfect to attend events at the Amsterdam Arena ,neutral
 Check in by the receptionist room didn t match what was booked basics such as a tv took 2 days to fix cups left dirty Nespresso machine didn t work list goes on  Location,neutral

 Room was small bathroom cramped Very disappointing for the price No Positive,neutral
 The bathroom was tiny the shower head had to be held in place or it spun away from you The TV was difficult to work Breakfast was cold disorganised and rubbery no offer of tea or coffee or explaination of how things worked Also no clear directions of how to find my room in the West wing and was told it s a bit of a walk to your room but you have the best views in the hotel Really best view as if see picture lol also the picture of the hallway was the distance from the lift to my room right at the end of the marathon length corridoor Breakfast staff were the only really friendly ones Also cos I used the mini bar to store some lunch for my course and two drinks they tried to charge me 24 but didn t explain why luckily I opened the sealed envelope to see what it was all about and called reception to argue the toss it was only when I said I hadn t used anything that they admitted that it was probably cos I stored stuff in the fridge Got it refunded eventually though i would not stay there again Also Arabic guests treated very differently than anyone else The room itself was nice and the location was handy ,neutral
 Hard pillows terrible coffeeNo Positive,neutral
 The single bed was really small even for a child Had forgotten a necklace which was never found back Free WiFi at the lobby is useless not even suited for mail check the same goes for their business corner useless I was never able to change my airplane ticket using these facilities  Location close to metro in the circle line ,neutral
 I asked early check in didn t get it I asked Late check out didn t get back to me on that and didn t get it Asked to include breakfast and they charged me Asked from the concierge from recommdetsiones nearby he told me that he is now in London and don t know places in London On the first day they didn t clean my room until 18 00 The Key didn t work half of the time The servers where bad in breakfast Nothing,neutral
No Negative the room is slightly small and not look like the picture on booking,neutral
 We booked a privilege Eiffel Tower double view room the view was not worth the cost of the room Could barely see the Eiffel Tower Had we have been on a higher floor the view probably would have been OK however we were only on 3rd floor No Positive,neutral
 The aircon in my room was not working and it was really hot Told staff who were reluctant to do anything immediate However they called a specialist the next day but then I had a rough nite due to the airco not working and on the second day they changed my room as it turned out the aircon in the other room had a major fault My only gripe was that after all my effort to explain to staff that the aircondition was not working and that the room was very hot The staff on call took it with a pinch of salt and advised that it would work only after some minutes but I already explained it was on for over an hour and still not working Next day they gave me free breakfast for the inconvenience I still think the staff should be more responsive to Guests requests especially when there is something wrong in the room  The rooms here are really spacious with good size bathrooms plus safe mini fridge and iron Really neat,neutral
 The room had window facing to the lobby could not able to let fresh air come into the roomNo Positive,neutral
 Tiny room with a sink in the room and not in the so called bathroom The bed filled the end of the small room so don t expect to climb in from either side as you have to crawl over your partner if you want the bathroom Oh and the bathroom has no soundproofing pretty embarrassing if you aren t open minded This place is fine for teenagers but not for grown ups doing business Wayyy too small and cramped Not even a wardrobe or iron Style over substance for sure and hideously expensive for what you get I m going back to The Hoxton or Hilton thanks  Location,neutral
 There was a lady serving breakfast the 21st of June that was extremely rude towards me and other guests ruining what should be a great start of a day to everybody The 22nd of June I hesitated to have breakfast because of a terrible experience but she wasn t there and service was great The fitness center is a tiny hot room with an elliptical and a stationary cycling next to each other Overall the staff is really friendly and the hotel is in a great location,neutral
 Mr TALEB the receptionest the way he talk about the very small room we have even I offer to bay for bigger room but he refused saying next time it s better to book through our site on the net Luckily the booking was for one night the second day i moved to better 4 star hotel with larger room breakfast included and even city tax included But Mr Taleb ask for it even booking reservation said tax include  Location was not bad,neutral

 The staff is really bad They didn t notify me anything and when I check in they said they didn t have the room for me because there is technical problem with their system gosh they relocated us on another one  Location is good,neutral
 The room 704 was very small for a double The bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed There was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use The bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it This should not be classed as a 4 star hotel in my opinion The Reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests  The Reception area was quite attractive ,neutral
 No security system for rooms Keys are handed out without verification of person s ID Old furnishings with thin walls where you can hear others sleeping Hallway noises because of cheap door Hotel has not kept up with market and security trends  Old fashioned hotel with Austrian charm,neutral

 Poor attitude of staff was very disappointing They were very unhelpful when they made a mistake with our parties booking and we found someone else in our room At first they refused to give us a different room as they said they were fully booked After complaining to the hotel manager and the company we booked with they miraculously found a room available for us It s a nice place to stay but I wouldn t say it s 4 star 3 at best Good location in very close proximity to Barcelone el Prat Airport and a 2 minute walk to the metro and local facilities such as a bank hospital supermarket and all purpose store Very clean rooms and good housekeeping,neutral
 Cold and beds hardNo Positive,neutral
 the hotel if compared to hotels we stayed in bellagio levanto florence and venice is not up to 4star standards and overpriced because of the 5star rating s fourie the hotel is a boutique type of hotel and in no way 5 star nothing more than 3star expensive for its facilities and easily 3km from the centre and 1500m from nearest metro i will not stay there again final remark s fourie,neutral

 THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL The management is false advertising BREAKFAST IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRICE OF THE STAY ONLY a Continental Breakfast is included SO unless you want to eat croissants and bread your entire stay at this hotel BE PREPARED TO SPEND 8 EUROS FOR A COUPLE OF EGGS EACH PERSON family 32 EUROS Adds up after a week in addition to the 2 2 500 for the week A sofa bed was also supposed to be part of our room and when we arrived the woman at front desk said NO not the deluxe room I am glad I printed off the booking com confirmation All these details including breakfast included were written there The general manager said I am embarrassed The restaurant is in complete disarray They try but come up far too short No room in the restaurant either Had to wait a few mornings to sit  Most of the staff were awesome and went out of their way to help Location was pretty good Not far from Metro about a 10 minute walk to Louvre Pretty good shopping all around ,neutral
No Negative the location only,neutral
 Accommodation was only very average for the cost The bed was uncomfortable giving a very poor night s sleep the night before a big event and is most certainly not what I expected Breakfast was over priced and best described as warm and seating was cramped with slow poor service Having stayed in a few hotels recently we have had far far better service and facilities for much less cost and with a personal touch too On departure our comments were not solicited My wife I wouldn t hurry back to this hotel  Pros Location was central for our needs ,neutral
 I was on a 2 night stay The first room I was given was in the basement and very cold I woke in the night freezing and had to put a coat over me as the duvet was very thin The air con also heated the room but was too noisy to leave on all night Also I was woken up at 4 30 am as I was very close to where they served breakfast and the staff started work at this time I was unable to get back to sleep I asked to change rooms for my second night and was given another room on the 1st floor It was warmer but the bathroom was dirty and there was no hot water lukewarm at best  The staff were very helpful tackling all the problems I encountered ,neutral

 We stayed 6 nights in Hotel Vienna While the hotel was non smoking the hallways were definitively imbibed with thick tobacco smell It was hot and there was no air conditioning Street was pretty noisy especially during the night and early morning The big let down for us was the staff s handling of our reservation for a bus trip to Salzburg which they recommended BTW We were told that everything was taken care of but the shuttle never came to pick us up from the hotel We were left in the cold to wait for the shuttle at 6 45 AM By 7 20 AM we gave up and went back inside The person at the desk was clueless We debugged with them later to find out that the staff we spoke with initially left a message for next staff to ask us for payment and complete the reservation which never happened and we were never told ahead of the supposed trip It was the last full day of our stay in Vienna and we did not have time and means to make alternative plans for visiting Salzburg So we missed it  Breakfast was a pretty good value Location was 15 20 minute walk from historical district ,neutral

 At almost 400US a night there was no breakfast included in that price nor was parking included It s really hard to give hotels top notch ratings when they refuse to even include the basics The pool was a slightly oversized hot tub actually in Sweden we ve enjoyed a hot tub larger than their pool There is an adorable boutique hotel in the middle of the city that has a way nicer pool but a rooftop that isn t even 1 5 the size of this place wish we were still there It starts with an O if you re interested and serves some of the best tapas in town Cocktails here started at 12Euros We went to some really nice restaurants and their cocktails weren t even 1 2 that price so I m not sure what you re paying for because it certainly wasn t the ambiance Other patrons were of questionable character There were American frat boys old Russian men with child brides or escorts and a guy with gang terrorist themed tattoos all over his body Multiple locations in the building guests were extremely loud and up until 6am one night and another group was up until 3am the next night keep in mind we were here during the middle of the week Somewhere else people were smoking pot which filled our room with the smell Needless to say we didn t get much rest Our room was never made up until well after 4 30pm We would go out all day come back for a break or to use the pool and without fail they would knock on our door sometime between 4 30 5 30 to clean our room so we would leave again to accommodate their late cleaning schedule Plus when you take a shower the water gets all over the bathroom floor and make sure your curtains are closed if you have a courtyard side room or all the office workers in the building that make up the open square will get quite the show Better off sticking with the Travelodge or ilk if you re going to stay at a chain hotel  The rooms were a decent size It was a bit out of the way if you want to get to the beaches but within walking distance of La Rambla and the hop on hop off bus routes The lounging area on top of the hotel was huge with plenty of lounge seating for about 30 guests plus a bar with additional seating The downstairs staff was really great and helpful in all matters when it came to printing things off restaurant recommendations and things to do around the city ,neutral

 I booked this hotel based upon the reviews I use Booking com because I love the customer based rating system and rarely have a bad experience I booked two rooms over a month in advance Initially we were five 3 weeks before the trip we were four so I changed the reservation Cancellation without penalty was possible until 2 days before the reservation The price remained the same so upon check in I asked them to please adjust the price as we were only 4 and I made the change 3 weeks ago I was told if I had made the reservation through the hotel he would be able to change it without a problem Since it was through booking com it was up to booking com and they would have to telephone them During check out I asked about this She said there were no notes in the system regarding this She claimed they would lose part of the commission if they changed the price 100 She also claimed that her colleague at the next desk had just accidentally deleted a note regarding the commission on our account I telephoned Booking com on my telephone and was told the commission isn t considered with a change only a cancellation The Booking com representative said the decision was completely up to the hotel and asked to speak to the hotel representative I heard the hotel representative say they booked a triple room they must pay for a triple room The hotel representative told me that Booking com didn t send them a notification I made an early check in request through the same Booking com system Notting Hill quickly responded with their check in and check out times and offer to hold our luggage If we had arrived with only 4 and wanted to change it upon arrival I completely understand However I made the change 3 weeks in advance This is rare so I was quite happy Usually things happen last minute and you are stuck with the charge This is where I feel Notting Hill completely failed Booking  The hotel is nice and well maintained The rooms were very clean and the beds were comfortable The location is convenient The pillows are a bit large We purchased a soda from the mini bar it s like a vending machine There was a strange taste it had expired the month before ,neutral

 The double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and I felt like I was in a prison cell when I complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however I did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have 2 single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay 50 more for 2 nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it 2 single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is No Positive,neutral
 I had read several bad reviews about overbooking and sending people to different hotel but I took a chance I had requested and early check in and we arrived very early 8am Upon arrival I was told that a representative had tried to call me to tell me their was a problem with the hot water in my room and they had no room for me I quickly went into defense mode and told them that I had read this bad review about them and couldn t believe it was happening to me Desk manager told clerk to call reservation and let them deal with it She called and told them I had read a bad review and they found a room for me but it wasn t ready They kept our luggage while we went to breakfast and said I was high priority to get in our room We returned about noon and it wasn t ready so we sat in the sitting room and waited and waited While waiting I heard various stories to incoming guests about the water and high priority to get in Different rooms were offered as was free breakfast to other guests I kept checking on room progress and was finally told that the guests had just checked out and we would once again be high priority to get in We did get in our room at check in time and we had a nice room Club room was what it was called It was in the basement but clean and nice We had a few drinks in fridge and basket of fruit Tea and hot chocolate Upon checkout Two of us left early and one remained I stopped at desk and said that one person remained and I wanted to make sure nothing was owed as it shouldn t have anything Assured we were paid up When last guest left they tried to charge her for breakfasts every morning She replied that she was told that all was paid and assured them we had not eaten breakfast We weren t charged The hotel made things right by my reservation but I am not sure i would stay again Most of the staff was very nice and helpful  The hotel was close to tube station and the area was safe ,neutral

 In the evening I have noticed there was no water from the tap First of all when it happened I was not informed about it and when I rang the reception they kept telling me to wait for half an hour as their maintenance team is already working on it for 2 hours After 2 hours of not being able to use the toilet I finally went down to the reception and complaind about it and the receptionist told me that she can only do and say what she was told to I get that but that should not be the response First she should have apolosiged about the inconvenience Any way I was offered another room The following morning when we checked out again there was no apology what so ever I know this is not a 5 star hotel but there is no harm in having 5 star service It doesn t cost any extra money but the effect can be surmounting  Location was fairly good as there were 2 tube stations near by And we enjoyed swiming and sauna even though the water was cold and the sauna was tiny Bed was good not too soft Wifi speed was quite good Even though interior in general needs refurbishment all area was kept very clean ,neutral

 They take 100 from your credit card and 3 days later it is not back in my account I think this is disgraceful I understand taking an imprint for incidentals but I have never had money taken from my account before at check in The receptionist was borderline rude when o questioned this practice It would put me of staying here again  The location and comfortable well equipped rooms,neutral
 This is the forth time I have used this group of hotels and the 2nd time I have turned up and had the excuse of there is a problem with the boilers and you have been affected and we will have to relocate you I told them to stop using the same excuse when they overbook the hotel as it does not work for me They tried to convince me to go to South Kensington Hotel which is told rubbish I managed to get another room in the hotel Just very poor attitude to use on customers  Location was 5 min walk from Paddington,neutral

 Menu in restaurant was very limited and there was nowhere else to eat within walking distance The room was cold It was set at 19 C you could turn it up to 24 by setting the temp and putting on the fan but that took hours Staff would go in to your room and turn the fan off when you weren t there so when you got back would still be cold Both myself and my partner got colds during our stay Snacks and bottled drinks were very expensive 3 50 for a bottle of water Would not recommend this hotel Bed was very comfortable,neutral

 Teeny tiny roomNo Positive,neutral
 Bed a bit too soft  Location staff,neutral
 The guy on reception did not appear to know what he was doing The room had a cheap DIY feel about it Bargain basement toilet paper Coffee was awful Luckily I bought my own Toiletries were cheap The bed was too big for the room The room had a fridge with nothing in it No complimentary bottle of water no mini bar What is the point of that other than to make a noise and disturb my sleep The view from my room was the verse end of other buildings The guy that checked me out was the most unfriendly hotel staff I ve ever come across The so called English breakfast was terrible No bacon non meat sausages no fried egg Definitely will not stay here again For a little more I can stay in the wonderful Durrants Hotel around the corner I could open the bedroom window and the bed was quite comfortable,neutral
 My travel companions room same nightly rate as mine was cramped and had a distinct dust and or mold smell Triggered my allergies in about 30 seconds I think you just get lucky or unlucky with a particular room there Restaurant was mediocre wait staff was attentive but it seemed like few of them were trained for the jobs they were doing It never seemed to be crowded which was probably a good thing I can t imagine how they handle high volume There are many restaurant choices in the area so it was not hard to find nice alternatives but there were several cold and windy times it would have been nice to stay in the hotel Did not buy the add on breakfast and very glad we didn t Cost of their afternoon tea was unreasonable and quite a poor value for quality  Bed was great My deluxe room was pretty spacious and comfortable Staff was friendly Various coffees were excellent ,neutral
 Front desk poorly organised and very slow No Positive,neutral
 Frige is nor workings Nothing,neutral
 Rooms and d cor are out of date and tired the place needs modernised then it would be a super hotel  Our room was not ready on arrival so we were asked if we wanted to upgrade which to save any problem we did and it was a good decision as we could have breakfast in the Copthorne suite The staff were very nice at breakfast and very helpful on the desk at reception would go back again but not at the full charged rate ,neutral
 On arrival we were put in a very small room which we were not happy with We were then moved to the correct club room but we thought it was still quite dull looking but more spacious than the first room The first night we placed our breakfast card on the door for breakfast to our room the next morning we woke up early expecting breakfast between 8 45am 9 15am and opened the door to see if anyone was coming and noticed nobody had even taken our breakfast card so we had to phone reception so our breakfast was late And again was late the second morning Very poor this year especially when our expectations where so high after a great time last year  The bed was very comfy had a great sleep both nights ,neutral

 Rooms are extremely small and noises from other rooms are only muffled a little which got very obvious by the active couple residing next to us  Breakfast was good and personnel was very responsive The room itself was clean and we very much appreciated the free to use mobile device ,neutral
 The room was disappointing very tired looking with dented furniture and cracked tiles in the bathroom 1 tissue only left in the tissue box and one milk carton empty and no breakfast teabags before we even started using the facilities this led me to doubt how well the room is actually prepared between guests On departure we asked a very smiley and undoubtedly friendly member of staff about express check out his knowledge of English however was very poor and he unable to understand a simple and standard hotel request which did nothing to support my previous impression of the hotel created on a visit 8 years previously  The beds were comfortable and the staff on the reception desk on arrival were friendly ,neutral

 I had a single room and it was horrible cold very basic no mini bar the bathroom fan would run for 30 minutes after the light went out the bed was tiny The safe wouldn t take my laptop which has never happened elsewhere They charge 10 for wifi but it was so bad I couldn t work their response was I should have come down to use it in the lobby They didn t charge me in the end The difference in price for a double room was only 10 and I wished I taken one hopefully they re better Ok for the price but the room really let the hotel down The location was good and the lobby area nice didn t try the spa,neutral

 Very noise because of DLR railway crossing nearbyNo Positive,neutral
 Bedbugs in standard room I was bitten all over Blood on sheet And huge hollows in mattress perfect place for those bugs to live in As many people say in such situations the personnel refer to your allergy I personally have none and refuse any possibility of bugs co existence in hotel Hotel personnel immediately provided another room though not upgrade and continued to say that room is clean I did not have possibility to get my money back and had to stay there in a new room at basement floor It was clean and big but everything in this hotel is tired already  Location is great,neutral

 Room expected complimentary shampoo etc particularly moreso with air travel limitations Was supplied when asked Refreshments limited supplies particularly tea on day 2 and 3 should ensure replenished daily automatically without request No biscuits Wouldnt describe the room as deluxe Not sure why called ramada apollo centre not in the centre by a long way didnt bother us as walkers but might be deceptive to a first time visitors as it is not centrally located  The staff were very helpful with information about local transport areas of interest etc The staff were very helpful in general in respect of hotel amenitites ,neutral
 The restaurant staff gave my partner and I the wrong meals but we said it was fine and would eat it After watching us take a few mouth fulls the clueless staff and the poor trainee lad ran back to our tables and whipped the plates out from underneath us and apologised saying we had someone else s meal They then proceeded to walk down a few tables and place the meals in front of another couple To top it off they knew we had eaten parts of the meal and the watched us AND brought us clean cutlery Very poor restaurant service Also I asked for a Port to come with my cheese board and after the waiting staff asked me about 10 times what port was it arrived How can a 5 resort have such little product knowledge and poor service skills I didn t even feel it was worth complaining about at the time of checkout as the staff looked down upon us I m presuming down to our age 19 21 even though we were fully paying polite customers This place has fully put my partner and I off of 5 hotels better customer service and waiting staff at a premier inn  Facilities very nice ,neutral

 food choice at the bar was below average and not very good when it came the room was bright modern with good facilities,neutral
 I have attached images and of room 667 which myself and my girlfriend stayed within on New Year s Eve I m not normally one to complain however I feel that this is not acceptable as a guess staying on a landmark occasion in a hotel for the first time What I found after waking up New Year s Day after my dinner reservations on New Year s Eve is the room had a consistent drip of water coming in from the ceiling which left the floor damp and also made the room smell This is no way acceptable considering the circumstances of the occasion was booked for  The overall hotel was good location etc,neutral
 The spa was closed and they did not tell us until we asked to use the spa They did not tell us the spa was closed before we got to the hotel when I was already communicating with them nor during check in The water in the shower constantly changed from really hot to really cold Just did not live up to the hype at all The location is right next to camp not but is a way out from the beach and the city centre but not too hard to get about on the metro just not ideal  Breakfast was quite nice The rooms were spacious and clean ,neutral
