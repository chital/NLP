9,This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.,bad
12,"The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top, arm holes and it was short. also i didn't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath.",bad
18,"So, ordered online. tried this on, boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes. 
back it goes. super cute but huge.",bad
43,"I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear, i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper, outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all, but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.",bad
150,"I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time, so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door, however, this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut, but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.",bad
199,Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,bad
280,The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.,bad
364,"I was really eager to receive this sweater, i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new, it is mostly shapeless, it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col",bad
376,"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",bad
395,"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.",bad
401,"Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my",bad
452,This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric. even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it.,bad
534,,bad
567,Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(,bad
571,"This sweater/tunic is very poor quality - the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it. and, without a chunky statement necklace, it looks like your grandmothers apron. there just isn't any style to it - has to go back.",bad
668,"If these jeans work for you, you're a lucky girl! the fabric is really thick and soft. pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail. i ordered down a size. they're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30"" inseam. the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway.",bad
671,"On a positive note the dress was very well made, great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack, i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.",bad
744,"A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.",bad
783,Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.,bad
854,"The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester. 

also, this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.

i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.",bad
868,"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details, but i don't need/want another cardigan. 

i'm 5'5"", 118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big, but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st",bad
965,"The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, you're a genius.",bad
1008,"I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in, it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.",bad
1017,"Too much fabric, not a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.",bad
1037,"I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss",bad
1306,I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!,bad
1395,"I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi",bad
1464,"I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters",bad
1517,"I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. 


fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. 

i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t",bad
1649,I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size,bad
1702,"The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point, i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress, be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur",bad
1809,"I bought this dress for a holiday party, and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it, but when i went to try it on, it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look, but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up, but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with, so they may sag.

overall, i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren",bad
1833,"As another reviewer pointed out, although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water, the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover, or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.",bad
1917,"Normally, hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out, the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra, you get to see the whole side of it. secondly, the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra, too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle",bad
1972,"The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously, seriously see-through.",bad
1979,"I love this brand, i literally live in their tops.. this one is a bit of a disappointment. it is made out of fabric that feels cheap, reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products. it's very thin, and see through. unless wearing a camisole/slip underneath, you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath- no muffin tops or back fat!!i got the black, and am keeping it only because i love the design, need a black top desperat",bad
2006,"I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable, however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed, so if you want a clean look, you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.",bad
2028,"It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print, though.",bad
2037,"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",bad
2132,I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.,bad
2208,"Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast"", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle",bad
2228,"I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.",bad
2321,"If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest, this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition, but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone, and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.",bad
2368,"I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being ""on"" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle ""ridge"" either as it was unflattering. it was returned.",bad
2412,"When i walked into my local retailer, two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways, and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom. unfortunately the small was sold out, but they were able to order it online and have it sent. gorgeous medium-to-lightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in.",good
2446,The dress looks better than the pictures online. it also arrives quite quickly after i placed my order. i am about 126 lbs and 4p fits me perfectly. the embroidery is so radiant in multiple colors against the navy blue dress. i am very please with this purchase.,good
2506,"Such a lovely skirt. i plan on wearing it to a formal event, but could definitely see dressing it down with a jean jacket. it is so feminine and beautiful. well made and fits fine.",good
2536,"Just received this and know i will get a lot of enjoyment from it. cute fit and since i have had something similar in the past, i know how versatile it is. nice soft material too!",good
2550,"I bought the navy version of this dress in the store and thought it looked pretty nice. i am 5'10"" and 145 pounds, and the small fit me great. i think that the dress looks exactly like it does in the pictures, at least for the particular color that i bought; the length comes about mid-thigh, as shown, and i would definitely have worn it to work. after looking in the mirror for a few more days though, i decided to return the dress, because i didn't feel like the shape of it was especially sensati",good
2553,"This sweater is more stunning in person then on the site. i saw it on the internet previous to seeing in the store. i purchased it right away, it was love at first sight!!. the detail on the collar is beautiful, and reminds me of the unique sweaters i have have in my closet from retailer from years ago that i still love. get it before it's gone!!!!",good
2621,"This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin, but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray, but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :)",good
2679,"A lovely, creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand, but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right, probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender, the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.",good
2712,This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.,good
2749,"Get this while you can. it will not last to hit the sales. it is a beautiful top, with very unique colors and pattern-reminds me of key west. it has a slight tent shape at the bottom, which is not how it appears to be, but the cut is very nice and well done. i wouldn't size down, as the armholes are not huge, and then it would be too tight. i will have to cut them about 1/2"" to not bug me, and i'm typically a med, which is the size i got. i could take the sides in about 1"" on each side, which is",good
2832,"This skirt is so cute!! highly recommend, super easy to dress up or to dress down. it isn't shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt. i have gotten so many compliments on it, random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it. it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up. also, if you're taller like me it is a little short in the back. overall, a great buy!",good
2887,"I love this robe, it is my new favorite for lounging around the house",good
2912,"This product is made of good-quality cotton material. it does run a little large, but it still fits nicely. i like the fact that the design is both on the front and face of the garment.",good
2988,"I love these jeans, cant believe i never purchased them earlier. i'm always a 30 in paige and ag and this was no different. i will say that i did fit into the 29, so it could be that they run slightly large. the fabric is amazing!! and the white is perfect. love that it is not see through and fabric is substantial.the length for me at 5'5 was at my ankle. i loved them so much that i bought them in white and beige/cream. highly recommend.",good
2989,"Love love love! i'm 5'8"", 122 lbs, 34b, and have an athletic frame (fairly narrow hips) and i bought an xs (in red.) usually i am a s with retailer for dresses (although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses), but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low back-design of the dress fit too loosely with the size s--it hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms, showing about 2"" of bra underneath. my guess is that if y",good
2992,"I've been buying pilcro for years. they are good quality, comfortable and wear well. my only complaint is (and this a general complaint of all pants today) is that these are cropped. i have a 35"" inseam. these stop well above my ankle but i love the color and the general fit. i'm used to having most of my pants (even those labelled tall) be too short so i don't mind it too much. i feel as though it runs a little big due to how much stretching that happens as you wear them. it's pretty much a tra",good
2994,"I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the ""girls"" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!",good
3021,"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",good
3035,This looks just like the picture. it's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots. love it!,good
3237,"This top is exactly as described. it can be casual with jeans or dressed up for evening wear. i would have kept it but it was slightly tight across the chest. i am 5' 1 1/2"" tall, 112 lbs & purchased a petite small. my bra size is a 34a.",good
3278,"I love camisoles like this, and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length, so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted, but not tight.",good
3287,Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.,good
3330,"Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did, it is lovely! i can't wait for next summer now as i'll definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan. seems tts (34d and 5'2"", i bought in a small and it fits nicely). a bit pricey for what it is ($68 or $58 would have been more appropriate i think) so try to get it on sale :)",good
3339,"This top is great - lightweight and flattering.
i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. 
i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.",good
3351,This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!,good
3380,"This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore",good
3434,So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms,good
3770,"I'm only 4'11"" and this top comes to the top of my knees. i could wear it as a mini-dress. lol! so, it is definitely a tunic for us shorter gals. now, it can be shortened. the underlayer can be cut and rehemmed shorter. then the over-lay lace has to be very gently snipped around the scallop pattern a few rows up. i'm debating whether i should do it or not. the bottom is simply a snipped off row from the fabric to create the scallop lace trim anyway.

as far as sizing, it's tailored. i didn't f",good

3915,"What i love especially about this dress are the comfortable, soft fabric and the shape of the back -- the scoop and longer back hem are very ballet dancer! the green & off white print is very pretty for spring. sizing is a little tricky for me as i'm between petite and regular sizes. the hem length in the sp is perfect, about 1.5"" above the knee in front, but the waist sits a little high. the top seam of the waist section is above my natural waist, and the bottom seam sits right under my navel s",good
4006,"I'm thrilled with this purchase, and looking forward to spending many years with this classic. on the subject of fit; i generally wear size medium for tops, but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges. since the thick-textured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch (with a mix of linen), the larger size will provide more room and comfort. i'm honoring my ""tts"" choice for folks who prefer a more ""fitted"" look. overall this piece wears well!!",good
4070,Love this tshirt! casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf!,good
4141,"Love this, it's a great update your basic tee!",good
4217,"Truly. adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned, much better in person than as pictured. the ivory has black, khaki and light pink polka dots. it is great with a pencil skirt or pants.",good
4226,"I want to love this top - it is so pretty, but i find the fit very odd. i think it runs big, but the arm holes seem to be cut really low. i would love to size down, but then i think the sleeves would be off. unfortunately, i will have to return it.",good
4238,"This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms. however, it does have a roomy fit, so you might want to size down. as a petite person, i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles. overall, comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color.",good
4363,"Ordered the ""white"" tee, but when it arrived today, i was surprised by how cream it looked.the cut is nice and as other reviewers mentioned, it is on the sheer side. still on the fence of whether or not i'll keep it.",good
4506,"This sweater is so much better in person. it is a heavy, soft knit that fits perfectly.i am petite and thin and took the reg xs. it is very flattering and drops just below the hips. the bottom is a bit flowy. i bought the beige and bright pink color. the pink is very dark and bright and has an orangy tint to it. i wear a dark beige cami underneath. super cute with cuffed dark jeans and black booties.",good
4528,"The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.",good
4535,"The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors. i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing, but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes. i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l. this dress has a slim cut, and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender, this runs true to size. if you have a larger chest, size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl",good
4601,"I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it's a little longer on me, it's great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you can't see the color in the photo, but there's a sea green lining which is a cute touch!",good
4644,"This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too, but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!",good

4733,"I've been coveting the first edition of this top (pineapples) and was thrilled to find this same style with lemons. i called my local store and put a few sizes on hold so i could ensure the perfect fit. good job i did! the top is beautiful but it's super tight across the back - fine if you want to stand still & look pretty. if, however, you want to go about your usual activities, like eat for example, i'd suggest you size up. for reference i'm usually a 2-4 in retailer tops (34b, 5' 5"" and 130lbs)",good

5060,"This is really one of those items that hits it out of the park. first, the fit is great. it's relaxed without being oversized or tapering way out or way in or something odd like that. it's nearly universally flattering to most body types and it's easy to wear with nearly anything. shorts, jeans, trousers, pencil skirts.....it looks great dressed up or down. 

i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely (sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua",good
5096,I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.,good

5134,"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/39, hips 36/37. tried the size 27, the usual for me in pilcro. they fit like a glove and i loved them. i clearly needed a 2-3"" heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear i'm a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky.
a win!",good
5136,"I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.",good

10494, The staff is the most unaccomidating I ve ever encountered My husband and I traveled from Paris to London With no problems with wifi I asked the staff three times the first night concerning the non functioning wifi in our room The one staff member basically said there was something wrong with my phone or user error Yet the moment I went downstairs and went to the dining area there was no problem connecting They just repeated over and over nothing was wrong and no one else had been complaining That was until someone walked in headed back to their room asking if the wifi was fixed yet according to the staff no one had made a complaint Fishy However the bed bugs is what sent us running I went downstairs after scratching all day to ask staff to switch us to a different room as I had about ten bites He said this was impossible as there were no other rooms available I asked three times then to speak to a manager who was unavailable til the next morning But once my husband realized he was getting bit he went downstairs to talk to the same person All of a sudden there was a room available This member of staff was rude the whole time and said I wasn t even considering moving to another room but 20 minutes prior there was no other room to move to So after asking for a refund and being on the phone with booking com the we were only refunded for two nights However I paid for 4 They only refunded me for the two nights we stayed Not even the two nights we did not stay and had to book another hotel down the street Which was so understanding and accomidatimg probably the single best hotel we ve stayed at When we are in London next we will not hesitate to book with Hilton double tree  The only good aspect of this hotel is that it s pretty close to the tube ,bad

15721, The room had a very old and dusty carpet Our phone screen was full of dust only after a few minutes we came inside the room I advised the hotel I was allergic to dust and she said that the room I paid for all of them have carpets inside If I haven t paid in advance with no refund I would have changed straight away Also the hotel was classified as a 4 stars hotel but when I called reception at 11 pm to request a blanket I was informed It was not possible to get one as the receptionist was completely alone in the hotel and he could t get the blanket I offered to get it at reception but the blanket was in a storage room he couldn t access I was cold and with allergy all night couldn t sleep and when I reported the experience to the receptionist she didn t know about the incident and didn t even apologize Very poor service and room conditions It is definitely not a 4 stars hotel No Positive,bad

15846, Staff was rude except for one young guy who worked a night shift I arrived late and the guy at the reception a more senior person did not even bother to respond to me in English he kept talking in Italian like he wanted to make a point The room was the size of a closet true I booked a room for a single person but still I am amazed they call that a room I went for a conference with Bocconi and I had to leave one night early Of course they did not want to cancel the last evening although I stayed there already two nights Because it was an emergency everything happened too fast on my side and I could not call bookings during that time period to report the issue So they just charged me without any shame The younger nice guy at the checkout told me that the management may respond if I threat them with my Bocconi ties But why should one do that and not expect fair treatment Other than that I ve seen better rooms in the hotel so just check carefully what you book and do not expect fair treatment  Location Ok if you need to be in that part of the city close to Bocconi U ,bad
15860, Horrible staff at reception except Antonio Absolute impoliteness Passive and sometimes negative approach to the client which makes very bad impression at the end Wifi works very slow or don t works at all at some moments It s not a first time that I stay in this hotel but would try to avoid coming back here again  Good location nice rooms,bad

16213, I had reserved online through booking com two rooms a double room for my parents and a single room for a friend of theirs I had booked both rooms as refundable on purpose if anything came up in the four months prior to their stay Reading more reviews on the hotel in different portals I got worried about feedback on the size of the rooms and decided to go and take a look myself as I wanted my parents to be as comfortable as possible The lady at reception was friendly and showed me two rooms the size of the double room was ok but the single room felt really claustrophobic Besides there was nothing warm or welcoming abt the place and I absolutely did not want my parents to stay there When I got home I discovered that I had made a mistake and only the double room was fully refundable while the single room was on a non refundable rate I called booking com right away and asked for advice they were very friendly and told me that most hotels agree to returning the money nonetheless which is in their discretion especially if there is still 4months to resell the room and the booking had just been made a few days ago I phoned the hotel straight away and they told me they would not be willing to let me off the hook I then walked by another day in the hope to have a better dialogue in person and the answer remained the same I did find a hotel nearby the Cranley hotel bina gardens for about the same price which was absolutely delightful with tasteful big rooms where my parents had a wonderful stay I can only recommend to anyone looking for a room to look elsewhere it s unbelievable how different a package you can get for the same price No Positive,bad

16405, Room service was patheticNo Positive,bad
16471, The room upstairs the attic room did not have any windows Of course this I did not know until I got there and there was no way to change rooms There were incredibly loud pipe noises at night There was no refrigerator Someone woke us up at 10 00 am demanding that we checked out although our checkout was noon great way to relax Thanks The front door guy would not open the door for us The towels were dirty They had blue led lights indicating where the light switches were and they were too bright at night It was waaaay too overpriced for what it was and the terrible service and misleading website  Location was ok ,bad
16489, The location is very far from the center of Barcelona The room was not ready when we reached The price 88 euro for a night without breakfast is a lot of money for this hotel  drinks in plastic glasses The pool is very small ,bad
16493, I ve been robbed in my room while I was sleeping Worst experience ever The staff didn t care No Positive,bad
16535, The location is awful it s right where Milan ends and surrounded by gas stations extremely hard to get there especially at night The building looks very nice on the outside but really old fashioned and outdated inside Apart from the bed the room was quite dirty and there was a bugger on one of the towels When we got there the light had gone off and the reception was all dark The city tax is almost double what it really is elsewhere we changed hotels during that same stay and found out The receptionist gave us indications and they were ALL wrong led us to a 2 hour roam around the city at 2am trying to find our way back Wouldn t recommend to ask her anything  The breakfast wasn t that of a 4 stars hotel but it was quite good The bed was very comfortable ,bad
16542, Too many things to mention The room that we were given was on the lower ground floor although we had booked a deluxe double room for two nights and pause Euros 670 and the excuse given was that rooms on the higher floors were not ready since we arrived early This was nonsense since we were booked for two nights and we arrived early on the second day Clearly the room was given to some other customer The reception staff was rude and unhelpful and we felt cheated and mistreated The room was tiny our luggage hardly fitted in and was very noisy with a distinct smell of damp We would never return to this hotel ever again not even pass outside  The bed was comfortable and the toilet was clean and recently renovated The concierge was helpful and informative ,bad
16611, They don t reduce de price and seriously I want my money back Worst hotel and politic for booking ever see  I book a double bed bedroom and they don t have it The solution is get me in a little bed in a 2 or 3 square meters Horrible experience I book for the next day and do the same operation so they fill the Hotel that way ,bad
16623, Food very loud at night Closeness to public transport,bad
16740, Room 510 the double room was extremely small and it was difficult for two people to move around the room There was no space to put luggage Rooms weren t ready at 2pm as they were still being cleaned Daily room and bathroom cleaning was poor  Breakfast was good ,bad
16768, Upon arriving to the Hotel for My Fianc e Birthday A concert at Wembley The Hotel for the night then afternoon tea at the Ritz Firstly the room was filthy there was rust all over the tap which looked like blood there was no Cold water so he had to brush our teeth with Hot Water the shower basin filled up with water very quickly and I had to turn it off twice wait for the water to drain before switching it back on The headboard was loose the bed was really uncomfortable I never complain but I felt as if this room 20 was totally not satisfactory and was the worst hotel experience of my life The paint from the celling was also falling down and the meagre window had filthy blinds  The Entrance is okay and the location is decent,bad

16866, The girl at the reception was very unkind at arrival Wanted us to pay for the whole stay 3 nights in advance Very odd as you normally pay when you check out and not when checking in Standard answer to everything hotel policy We agreed to pay the first night in advance but she insisted on paying the following 2 nights before 11 next morning and she left a message on my voicemail to remind and come to the desk immediatley Furthermore the curtains in the room didn t block the light at all and the airco didn t work Found some trash on the floor from the previous guests No cups in the cupholder in the bathroom The room in itself was small but nice but that didn t make up for all the other things  The location is good Close to Bakerstreet and Regent s Park ,bad
16889, Hotel staff held my bags and I had to pay 70 quid the hotel is old and dirty never stay here ever Nothing,bad
16943, The room s standard is absolutely not a 4 star hotel standard No Positive,bad
16961, Very cold during the night no heatNo Positive,bad
16970, This property presents a facade of an up to date hotel It is definitely NOT what it appears to be The reception staff three individuals at different times became surly and argumentative when I had to correct their wrong assumption They also had no explanation why the room was not ready on check in past the stipulated time 15 00 The cleaning staff is unaware that if you place the Please Clean Now sign on the door at 8 00 am you have the right to expect that at 15 00 the room will be clean The room was dirty candy in the shape of hearts were in the corner perhaps left from Valentine s Day this was early August Also the housekeeping person failed on three of the four days to replace the Body Wash and Shampoo even though the empty bottles were in full view The housekeeper also failed to replenish the notepad even though it had been only used to indicate that the four euro on it were for her The beds do not have electrical outlets so if you use a CPAP machine or other devise you are out of luck unless you bring your own extension cord The shower was so constructed that a person slightly larger than average size could not enter it Someone had obviously ordered the glass partitions without measuring the opening There was no coffee maker in what was described as a premium room only a water heater with instant coffee Who drinks instant coffee in 2016 The website for the hotel advertises a refrigerator in the room but going back to my original comment concerning the facade that is created the refrigerator in the room was so filled with their overpriced items that you could not place even the smallest item of your own in there They had even removed the shelves on the door to crowd more of their items in it All in all this was a hotel to be avoided To be clear I have stayed in other NH hotels in Amsterdam Brussels and Berlin I certainly hope that this property is an enigma  The location was great in the city center as the name implies ,bad
17050, Staff were rude and extremely unaccommodating Booked two double rooms through Booking com When we arrived my in laws were put in an executive double room seconds after me and my partner were put in a standard twin despite both rooms being booked as doubles When questioned we were told we had been put in a twin because they were full we booked in May and there were masses of people still arriving never mind the fact our parents had been booked into their executive room after us I made the booking and paid for both rooms myself When I pointed out the backwards nature of what had happened with our rooms staff couldn t justify it kept changing their story as to why it had happened and essentially told us it was tough This was at 4pm on arrival Throughout discussions with various member of staff I was spoken to like a second class citizen After pushing the issue speaking to staff three times in total I was assured that we would be moved by the time we returned from our night out This didn t happen and we were stuck with our room when we returned at midnight Our whole experience of this hotel was negative Also towels were dirty and the shower flooded the floor but that s really beside the point Rang the hotel s customer service line the day after over three weeks ago now and still haven t had a response to my complaint Will not be using them again completely ruined my boyfriend s birthday weekend away and I was left in tears due to my anger at the outcome and the way I was treated by staff  Semi convenient location for Wembley Stadium considering all nearer hotels were full ,bad
17124, The room is old and worn out moreover the bathroom was miserable I have requested from the receptionist to change the room or upgrade and i will afford to pay the difference but unfortunately the Hotel is full as the receptionist told me I could hear the person in the room beside snoring Had construction in the room above for 2 nights starting at 7 30 AM I have complained the first time and they told me it won t happen again and they asked if I would like to change the room for the last night I refused and requested to delay the construction till 9 30 AM and off course what I requested didn t happen I contacted the manager and the manager all she could do is provide me with 1 complementary breakfast for the last night Very terrible hotel and very terrible costumer service No Positive,bad

21181, We were on the 4th floor and the curtains in the room drove me crazy seems a small thing but the roof was sloped and the curtains were the wrong size so didn t block the sun light out and it didn t give me much chance for a sleep in  First time we have stayed in a 2 bedroom family room and it was perfect and really good value for London ,good

22282, The English breakfast was disappointing in that it was undercooked to the point that we both sent it back To be fair we weren t charged for it but as we were only there for one night and we both really enjoy our food and look forward to a cooked breakfast when away it was a disappointing finale to the trip Room was clean and comfortable,good
22331, Hotel is situated at a side road and you would need to look for the road signs to locate it Room is very small But since it was just me and my girl it was not an issue  Hotel was very clean comfortable walking distance to inner ring and Mariahilf Nearby attractions Metro n trams are a doorstep away Breakfast spread was exceptionally good Bed is super comfortable Staffs were friendly and attentive Even offered me an umbrella without me having to ask as it was a wet day Near one of the biggest Christmas Markets ,good

24076, The room design not a big fan of the open bathroom style the sink is outside while the toilet and the shower are separated wasn t very convenient The location friendly staff comfy bed,good
24169, Fairly small selection of standard continental breakfast fare A bit of a walk to the Metro and 3km from the gothic quarter  Very courteous and helpful staff I don t normally bother hotel staff but for one reason or another I needed their help on four occasions and all four different staff members met my requirements without hesitation or fuss The best meals we had in Barcelona were all within 5 minutes walk of the restaurant Great bus links Park up the car and get the T10 public transport travel cards ,good

24862, I found very few negative points but at a push I would say that the bathroom was quite small and this could be a problem for some We could hear a little noise from the next door room this wasn t a problem but if the guests were very loud it could be an issue Overall though we loved the park grand and will definitely come back next time we visit London  Our stay at Park Grand was excellent so close to paddington station We booked a club double room 307 and it was a lovely surprise to find it was on two floors with a maisonette living area up some stairs It was really nice to have that extra space and a proper kitchen sink and microwave as well as the complementary snacks and drinks Our bed was super comfy and a special thanks to the staff who were all lovely and to whom nothing was too much trouble ,good

25762, There are things I did not like 1 The internet was very slow 2 Nobody told us that at a 4 stars hotel the tourist tax is euro 5 per day and per person adding euro 10 per day to the room rate 3 The receptionist tried to push us to order an unreasonably expensive limousine service at a rate more than double that of Milan public cabs 4 There was only one night stand with one night light for two beds and the second bed was arranged with the pillow on the opposite side of the night stand which was was bit weird 5 There was only a heavy comforter and no light sheet to use even if it is Summer  On an August day when offices shut down for vacation we were able to have a very good rate at this four stars hotel The room had a nice and large balcony ,good

26109, Extensive renovation going on Building noise during the day Canal side bar and balcony and restaurant was closed The one bar open had a DJ playing non stop Ibiza night club music when their were just the two pensioners of us there Due to the renovations there is only one extremely expensive restaurant open forcing us to go out to eat We booked this stay last November having been several times before However we were not informed at that time about the change of ownership and the new owner s plans to refit the whole place My complaint to the management fell on deaf ears  Location Close half mile to shopping cafes and a mile or so to the museum quarter ,good
26119, No issues to report although check in could have been a bit quicker It was busy but more reception staff would have cleared queues quicker  Excellent location close to points of interest around Tower Bridge and transport links Hotel well designed Staff very good ,good
26173, Our room was not ready at check in and the room had some issues The Windows need replacing or to be re sealed as we heard every outside noise The a c fan was not enough to drown out the noise Bathroom door seemed as if someone tried to break it hinges were all off kilter This was a return trip to the hotel for us First time was wonderful not sure what has happened  The location is great Front desk staff friendly and helpful The public areas of the hotel are very nice The rooftop allows for fabulous views of the city ,good

26401, Broken air con in room The room and the service helped to make our anniversary special,good
26459, What is the point of that green night light in the room other than to annoy The light switches generally were insanely difficult to work out  We were very pleased to be upgraded on arrival to a studio suite which was very comfortable although located across the road in one of the several historic buildings which make up the complex The location whilst not in the centre of things and requiring a taxi to reach is a short walk for example from Broadgate Circle which has a wide range of bars and restaurants ,good
26479,No Negative Loved everything ,good
26527,No Negative Staff s service was impeccable Made to feel very welcome and as though nothing is too much trouble Executive lounge is amazing and well worth the difference in rate ,good
26537, I was disappointed with the choice of food at breakfast for the price we were charged Everything was very tasty however choice was limited and I found that the way bread was touched and cut by every other person was very unhygienic We arrived at the restaurant at around 9 30am and there were no rolls left for us and only 1 5 loafs of bread left I would also like to note that cups of coffee are tiny and coffee was luke warm  I loved the room and how friendly and helpful the staff were I also thought that having a laundry room was a great idea and very helpful ,good
26538, When we entered room the heating did t work n and room was quite cold In addition the TV a computer screen did t work either I called reception A technician came in and fixed the TV he plugged in the cable somewhere The he opened cover at ceiling It was full of dust Then he fixed the heating After half an hour it started blowing hot air All this should have fixed before a customer is in the room  Location is great Close to undergroud and river Reception staff and information staff was very kind and helpful ,good

27101, Nothing Good size room lovely bathroom comfy bed great location,good
27105,No Negative Room was very clean and comfortable Staff pleasant and friendly,good
27117, Despite being on the 6th floor the street noise was very loud and carried on throughout the night I felt that we were being sold to a lot most of the toiletries in the bathroom were for sale rather than being there to use There was also a tray of items all with a price list in the room It wasn t a cheap hotel so I felt some of these items would have been nice perks rather than added extras Also the rooftop bar has a private party when we were there so we couldn t enjoy it  The d cor of the room was great and very interesting quirky The bed was huge and very comfortable The view from the room was great and the window seat was perfect for people watching ,good

40090, The only thing that might have been better was that the room was not ready when we got there However this was totally understandable since they had a huge wedding going on and we suspect a lot of the guests didn t leave their rooms on time They offered us a complimentary drink whilst we waited The wait was not too long  We didn t avail ourselves too much for breakfast as we were having an early lunch However the display was excellent and pretty much anything was available We were particularly impressed with the overt friendliness of all of the staff who couldn t do enough for us Really makes the cost of such an hotel worthwhile ,good

42301, The hotel itself is wonderful and the staff super so difficult to be negative but the prices for food and drinks I had expected with it being a 5 star hotel to pay a little more but the charges for soft drinks and alcohol ice creams and snacks etc even around the pool were extortionate Another very minor niggle only provided with 2 coffee capsules per day for the coffee machine and when we requested additional capsules we were told that there is usually a a charge for these the capsules are 29p each here in the UK Kindly they waived the charges and provided us with 2 further capsules Please don t let these points put you off staying at Hotel Arts it is a truly special hotel and we certainly hope to return  The suite was wonderful with incredible views Very comfortable beds and excellent bathroom facilities and products The pool is super although a little cold and the other outside spaces are very well maintained The staff are very helpful and keen to assist with any queries or questions asked ,good

65897, For us the main problems resulted out of disappointment and a misalignment with our expectations in general Rooms are small as per Paris standards but that was fine for us since we did not really spend too much time in the room Toilettes are separated from the bathroom So inside the room the toilette and the bathroom are located in two different smaller rooms This was a problem because if you need to go to the toilette in the middle of the night there is no way you are not going to wake up your fellow traveller You need to close one door and open another and walk around in the room to do that There is an Apple TV which I think might be available for use as a computer That was slightly noisy during the night like in sleep mode so not absolutely noisy but this was disturbing for us The receptionists were trying to be helpful and friendly they answer all questions and smile constantly but in our opinion some of that was forced and not always genuine and effective really We went down to the spa to see where it was and how it was and thought it was smaller than it seemed in the pictures We were told that there was a steam room but we saw only the Turkish hammam Maybe this is the steam room In the end we could not use the spa anyway since it was not open before 9 am in the morning The halls on the floors where the rooms are are really dark and lights are automatic In the evening when you are walking to your room this can be a bit bothering and scary really When we went down to get coffee or breakfast there was no one available in the bar terrace area to ask for anything We ended up going out for our morning coffee which was a shame because the terrace seemed nice and we might have wanted to enjoy a cup of coffee in the terrace  The location of the hotel is not bad it was a neighborhood we wanted to be located in However it may not be ideal for all travellers as proximity to some of the more touristy areas airport transfers are not the easiest The hotel is said to have a transfer service though which may be appealing to some travellers We did not use it It seems like this is a newer hotel which was a plus for us It was mostly modern and clean WiFi worked without disruptions ,neutral

67934, Major problem was with the booking dept Beginning of July I booked a room for 21st November About 2 weeks or so before my staying I got an email saying my credit card was not valid and to enter a new one within 24 hrs otherwise my booking would be cancelled I did so but in the following 24 hrs I received the same mail again I decided to phone the hotel I spoke to two different ladies the second of which contradicted what the first one had told me the first said I could not enter a new credit card but I must use the same one I had made the booking the second said the opposite According to them I received an email back in July about the credit card problem This is totally false because if that had been the case I would have done something back then so not to loose the booking Why was it not automatically cancelled if they contacted me in July and I had done nothing Why was my booking still confirmed at the beginning of November Anyway beginning of November I get this email saying that my credit card is not valid and to provide a valid one within 24 hrs I do so but this too is refused and I have 24 hrs time to provide another or I loose my booking So I phoned the hotel itself and asked what they suggested to solve the situation I had tickets for the concert at Arcimboldi so didn t want to change a hotel I booked back in July with a good rate to book another just a few days before my event as the employee remarked I was suggested I send my credit card number by e mail is this acceptable I decided not to do it and entered another credit card number which a good friend agreed to give and this time it was ok fortunately I had a lot of hassle and this 24 hrs time threatens was very unpleasant since all the credit card numbers I gave were valid I checked with the bank and since no e mail was sent to me in July  Booked the hotel for a night out at the Arcimboldi theatre which is walking distance The room was very nice and clean Service was poor at breakfast and at the bar We went for a drink in the evening and waited for some time then waitress acknowledged us so we thought we d be tended soon so waited longer but nothing happened and we decided to leave The bar wasn t that busy but there was only one waitress on a Saturday night in a Milan full of events Breakfast was of an extremely low quality for a 4 stars hotel However I d recommend it and would go again since breakfast is not what I look for when in Milan Just take the metro find yourself in town and there will be thousands of nice cafes ,neutral
