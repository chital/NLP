review,classification
"I really wanted this dress to be perfect, but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me, perhaps it works better on a taller frame.",bad
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,bad
The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,bad
"Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast"", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle",bad
"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer, but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest, but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"", 140#, 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted, and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",bad
"This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me, so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange, not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.",bad
"This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe",bad
"I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition, the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba",bad
"This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders",bad
"I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.",bad
This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.,bad
"Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.",bad
"I love this top (so cute and comfy!), but i wore it twice, washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost, i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing, especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......",bad
It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.,bad
"Beautiful fabric! unfortunately, i had to return it. after just one wear, it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!",bad
"I'm a short girl, but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me, i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad, which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still, it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.",bad
"This is a beautiful skirt, but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all.",bad
"I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately, the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside, but it's not...so i'm taking them back.",bad
"I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.",bad
"After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful, but only for one use.",bad
"I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.",bad
"I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived, i was excited to try it on, but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large, not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end, i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad, as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.",bad
"This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.

this one is going back.",bad
"I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"", 112lbs...with a small frame.",bad
"Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric, was bulky, and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..",bad
"Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.",bad
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.,bad
"This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering.",bad
Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.,bad
I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.,bad
"I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me, as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.",bad
The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.,bad
"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",bad
"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet, that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible.",bad
"I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy, cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly, but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it's completely unwearable. i'm super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer.",bad
It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.,bad
"Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn't get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best, tight in the hips, extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can't see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric, skip.",bad
"Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.",bad
"The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.",bad
"This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large, it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.",bad
This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.,bad
"I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.",bad
I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.,bad
The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible. i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders. what a pity. had to return.,bad
"When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.",bad
"Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent",bad
I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..,bad
"On the hanger i thought this had a chance, but oh geez... puffy sleeves, itchy, metallic thread, lace... what a mess. and thin. and uncomfortable. no, no, no.",bad
"Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first, the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact, in the store, it was displayed with a jacket over it. online, the orange looks completely different,",bad
"I absolutely love mother jeans, but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too, i always size up in white jeans, and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother, and ordered a 29 in these.",bad
"These are nice, flattering short. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each short. exmaple: on the picture online the left leg seems to be mint green and the right one blue. the ones i received the left leg is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right leg is orange. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block bra as well and it has the same issue: colors and patterns are",good
I saw this dress and i thought it would be perfect for that night that you don't feel like wearing just jeans yet you don't want to be overdressed. the dress is 100% cotton and is extremely comfortable. i paired with an open toe wide heeled bootie and a long necklace. the dress has a slight a line bottom but fits close to the body in chest and arms. extremely flattering for all body types and the color is a pretty blue. a dress for all seasons!!!!,good
"I love the print of this dress; the deep blue really is striking. i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore, it's hard to justify the price. i can't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering. still on the fence. . . it would be better as a sale piece.",good
"What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st",good
"Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3""). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy.",good
"I really like this sweater. it is surprisingly warm. it is not very form fitting (which can slenderize), but i enjoy layering with a lacy tank and don't have to worry about sucking in the guy either ;). i'm 5' 8"" and typically wear between a 6-8, the medium was definitely baggy, i ended up with a small in 2 colors.!

oh, and the bow detail really does add a fanciness to an otherwise comfy/snuggle sweater.",good
"I was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery. i actually really loved this dress! i think it hides body flaws. i tired on the xs, but the small was a little more flowing. it was comfortable and very fun to wear.. i am short, so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me. go try it on too see if it fits for your body style. it was great for me",good
"The material is so soft, and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'1 #145 and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit, and a polished-casual look.",good
Tried this after missing out on the very similar terra max dress where petite sizes sold out. the medium is perfect and the style can be dressed up. wore it on a day out and two strangers complimented me on the 'great dress'!,good
The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring. it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming. i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly.,good
"This is a really beautiful kimono. soft and flattering. as well as eye catching.
can be dressed up or down.
absolutely recommend",good
I fell in love with this dress immediately. gorgeous print and colors. light and breezy. classic and comfortable. the petite length is perfect for my height and hits a few inches above the knee. i have a small bust (34a) but a wider rib cage so the petite small was a perfect fit. couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.,good
"I agree with another reviewer. the neckline is just right, not too low cut and a normal bra should work fine. also it would be nice if this dress were lined. the top part has more than one layer so that's not an issue, but the skirt doesn't so i'll likely wear spanks. other than that, it's a great maxi and perfect for spring or summer (light weight)..",good
"This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.",good
"Green color is fantastic - dark forest green. material, wool, is substantial and of good quality. however, on my 5'1"", 120lb athletic frame, i felt both the petite xs and petite s were too small for me when worn over a v.v.v. thin ls t-shirt. i also thought it was a bit too short in the back. the petite medium would have been a great fit for me, but all gone.",good
"This dress brought out my tamed inner kitty--there's a collar so of course it's tamed! i'm in love with this unique print that roars retailer to all who admire. this is not a hot weather dress because of long sleeves and fabric. dropped stars cuz it's yucky poly/rayon and you need to size down or you'll be drowning in fabric (this cat doesn't swim!) looks great belted or underneath my black wool sweater. i'm 5'3"" 135# 36c and i purchased size 8.",good
"I never would have thought to choose this, but an retailer associate suggested the black sweater as a topper while i was trying on the camellia dropwaist dress, and it made a sale, i bought them both! the sweater, while not decked with beads or embroidery, adds an incredible definition to any outfit that is overly flowy. i would say the photo above showing the grey sweater says it all. usually a size 6 in retailer dresses, the small fit well. i appreciate the cotton fiber content, as well as the ver",good
,good
"I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it's like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9"", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me.",good
"I got the purple version in a xs. i purchased it on sale so it was a great deal. i usually don't wear large prints but i loved the print and the ruffle detail. very feminine. it also hides the tummy roll, so that is always a plus! i've worn it a few times and threads are already unraveling, but easy fix.",good
"I should have known with the combined sizing, but this is very wide, even in the xs/sm. it's a beautiful sweater, a thicker gauge of yarn than it appears to have, and the pointelle ""holes"" are also larger than they appear. it is fairly itchy if you don't mind that. just way too big for my small frame--almost falling of the shoulders, which is not the look i was going for. if you want a wide and boxy look, or have a larger frame, this could be great for you. it is pretty and quite unique.",good
"The first reviewer said it was small in the bust, but the 0p i ordered fit everywhere, rib cage and all, but was gaping at the bust (in the back). i would say overall it was true to size but if i sized down, it would be too snug in the rib cage. i am 30dd for reference there and waist is 26.5 inches,

otherwise, the make is very pretty, i like the texture in the fabric, the color is very pretty as well. embroidery seemed high quality, but i decided to pass on it, even on sale, since it didn't",good
"I love the design on this top- so playful! i was super confused on what size to buy since all the reviews said different things, so i bought a size 0 and size 2. i'm usually a size 0 or xs is most clothes, and after trying both on, i kept the size 0. it's ever so slightly snug in the chest area, but the sleeves and shoulder areas fit perfectly. the size 2 was a little too wide and drapey and the sleeves were a little long.",good
Love this dress - haven't worn it yet but wow the design / artwork of the fabric is beautiful !! waiting for weather to cool off a bit so can wear with my off white suede gogo boots ....,good
"When i received the dress, it was true to size on the bust and length. i didn't purchase the petite, but i wish i did since i am 5'2. i tried to wear my wedges, but it's still long. i love the dress and would definitely recommend it.",good
"Got this dress in the mail today, and will have to say that it is not the most figure flattering dress i own. my 5'5"" athletic frame looks pretty boxy in this. that being said, the fabric is a soft, shiny blue/green. the garment swings nicely and has a slightly lower hem in the back (on me, anyway) and i think that's fun. who needs close fitting clothes during the holidays ? i'm keeping it. i plan to wear it with hot pink tights and boots.",good
"I bought this in blue and can't wait to wear it, feels so soft. exactly like the picture.",good
Cute top; somewhat sheer but color and fit are great. fits slim but true to size.,good
"I just saw this in the store and had to pick it up. i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of tops/dresses. i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it, paired with slim fitting black pants and boots.",good
,good
I didn't think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love!  i am typically a medium and this was true with this.  i have a 34dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesn't show. i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too.  just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it.,good
"Every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer, and i quickly make the purchase without any regret.
without being stuffy or old, this top is simply elegant. the floral is very high-end designer (think italian made) for a fraction of the cost. made of 100% bamboo, it is light without being sheer. there is no need for a cami with this one. the fabric has the body of a good linen, but it doesn't wrinkle nearly as much. it does require dry cleaning, though, if this matters to you.",good
"I was originally looking for a denim skirt with a fit and flare shape. i then saw this skirt and decided it was much more versatile than denim. it is a mid weight skirt, lined, good length...just above the knee, and the swingy shape is perfect. i will wear it now with boots and a chunky sweater. when it warms up, flats and a short sleeve sweater will be cute! i ordered a small, but i really should have paid more attention to the other reviews because it does run large! i ordered another one in e",good
"This is a great, versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering, and the material is soft and lightweight. this, like many retailer tops, runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium, and although i liked the way the tee hung, it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store, so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely, and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:)",good
"I tried this product in store in red and fell in love with the fit, it fits in the most beautiful flattering way, red looked gorgeous - rich glossy fabric, this could easily be one of those effortless summer transition pieces that can go from a day dress into incredible sexy night outfit. the fabric was very lush and had this rich gloss to it, i have never seen a fabric like that, it almost looked coated. red being such a statement piece was a bit too much for me, so i decided to order the produ",good
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately. finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard (small chest, rounder in the middle and hips like whoa) but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering. love the quality and feel of the fabric. i've worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath, but then again it isn't a piece i plan to wear to work. i'm usually a sz 8/10 and got the medium regular which is perfect. i'm 5'5 and the bottom hit",good
"This has a unique style and feel to the fabric which i like. however, the color is not orange as advertised. it's more or a reddish pink tone which was somewhat disappointing because orange is what i was looking for. i will still keep it to pair with other outfits in mind.",good
"I saw this dress in the new arrivals in red, and it caught my attention, but not enough to order it (the pictures online for other colors didn't look that great). well, i saw the black in the store and decided to try it on as it looked like hte cut would be cute. it fit like a glove and i actually love the pattern. i ordred the peite to compare, and also the red to see in person... we shall see which is the winnrer!",good
I had been waiting for this dress to go on sale and when it did it was only available in a petite xs. the only reason i said it ran big is because it was a petite and i usually wear a regular. i am 5'4 size 2. the length is perfect and i have really narrow shoulders so the petite fit perfect. the details on this dress are just beautiful and extremely comfortable.,good
"This was a perfectly nice dress, but embroidery was less elegant than i had expected. be sure to look closely at the neckline, where the material is thick and somewhat informal. it's pretty, but doesn't work for me. otherwise, it is a well made, comfortable, easy-to-wear summer dress. (i sent it back, but thought about it for a while first.)",good
Really great pair of pants/leggings. considering a second pair. great flattering fit. i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all.,good
"I love the style of this dress and the way it lays. looks nice on, just wish it were longer. i normally wear size small but had to return for a medium so that it was long enough.",good
"I have these pants in the brown & red colors, and i love them both equally! they are stretchy, and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them, but retain their shape & neatness.",good
"Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point, as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.",good
"Bought this tank on a whim, but i'm so happy i did! so flattering, comfy and well made.",good
"These socks are soft and comfortable, and they are very short so they'll be good with booties. i couldn't tell from the pictures but the pale gray dots are surrounded by a border of subtle silver thread. they're adorable!",good
I love the swing and the pretty color of the dress. it's fun to dress up or dress down. the fabric is a little thin so you will need good undergarments if you have lumps and bumps.,good
Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets,good
"I absolutely love this blouse. it is so soft, easy to wear and can be worn with so many things. i'm 5'3, 135 pounds and got a small (regular). i could've gone for the petite but decided to do regular. love it!",good
"So glad i gave this a try. looks so much better on than seeing it online!!! i doubt i will ever wear it tied, but it's very cute and comfortable. it will probably be my go-to sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold. it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes! 
fits tts.",good
This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.,good
"I wore this to a gala and i plan on wearing it over and over again. the dress is very comfortable and looks polished. i wore this dress for 12 hours and did not want to take it off. the embroidery is beautiful and appears to be well done. i am 5'5 and the dress hit me 2 inches above my knee. i highly recommend this dress, i received so many compliments.",good
,good
"This top is very pretty. it's a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder.",good
"Agreed with the previous reviewer, this is the same dress as the evanthe dress that came out this summer, but in a rich beautiful red/wine color. the color differences in the pattern are , however, more subtle than the summer version, remaining in one palette. yo u can't tell from the picture, but the back is longer than the front. the neckline is very flattering, i found this one a little more snug than the evanthe (around the rib cage), tried on 00p (size for evanthe) might be better as 0p in",good
These pants are very soft and comfortable.  great for lounging around the house and for sleeping.,good
,good
"Love this poncho! it's casual, has a bit of a sexy vibe, comfy. great with leggings, probably boots once it's a little cooler. soft and lacey, lace is sheer so a cami is needed.",good
I love this kimono! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame. you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement!,good
"I got size 26 and they don't fit me as ankle, they fit me as long skinnies, but the quality is so good. they're smooth and stretchy, but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell it's quality denim. a great pant buy if you're looking for soft as butter grey jeans.",good
"I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but the design really spoke to me. i've been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love, and this was it. great, light fabric and beautiful design. i love it. worth every penny. can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured.",good
"I feel both confident and comfortable in this dress. it runs true to size, though maybe just a little bit large. i enjoyed wearing it from the get-go!",good
"Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments. 
unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine, ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!",good
"Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.",good
"Very pretty top. runs a bit large (i generally take an xs and the xs in this top fits me a little longer and larger than on the model). comfortable and easy to wear. nice cut with angled front and bit longer back. did develop a small hole very quickly as some thinner and tissue tees do but hoping that's unusual as i did buy two different colors of this tee shirt and will be totally disappointed if this happens to both, especially at this price.",good
"This is a great summer dress. i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies. i kept the l because the fit was better. the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful. lots of compliments, it is lined, highly recommend.",good
"Nice fit, stretchy fabric, but they do not stretch out of shape or so much that they are too big after wearing for a few hours. very true to size and great length. i am going to buy another pair because i know once i wear these out i will want a back-up!",good
"Very well made and comfortable with nice finishing touches and fabric. looking forward to wearing it many different ways either with jeans, pants or long dresses. i'm 5'1 and petite sizes were out of stock so i chose small regular which looks great, not too long so i won't have to shorten.",good
"Bought this top on a whim on a tops sale and am really glad i did. it's a nice two-in-one piece that can be dressed up for the office with a blazer or down with jeans and a sweater. striped portion of the shirt is a ponte stretchy material. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the small was perfect and even roomy (i don't like things too tight).",good
"I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about this beautiful skirt. it is so soft and comfortable, very flowy and flattering, i have a smaller waist but wider hips, and this accentuates all of my best features! i highly recommend this skirt for any occasion! i wore it to my bridal shower and got soo many compliment and i really couldn't stop touching the material. what a wonderful addition to my closet!",good
"This is a true retailer dress, cute and quirky. kudos for the built-in liner (with scalloped hem, very pretty) and pockets. i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress, and the white background makes the colors and details really pop (pun intended!). i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips. i?m 5?2?, and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees). but when i tried on size 6,",good

Looks wonderful with a pair of dark skinny jeans and cowgirl boots.,good
I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.,neutral

"I am 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs., and ordered a m in this. i'm usually between a s and m. it was too big and didn't have any shape to it. i don't think a s would fit much better. also, i ordered the pink but it was really a coral. if my local store had a s i would probably try it on in a different color, but they don't. i'll have to return this. it looks so cute online.",neutral
"I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected, and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.",neutral
"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering",neutral
"The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.",neutral

"I bought the orange in xxs petite, and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.

i like a swing style, but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer, and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.",neutral
"I am curvy and this top, while stylish and i love the pockets, just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are, which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy, just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere, i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s",neutral

I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.,neutral
"I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on, but didn't fit me.",neutral
"I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however, the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out",neutral
"I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve, but the sleeves do not fit loosely, they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms, so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves, but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking, but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy",neutral
"I really love this top, but am afraid i may need to return it, because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it, and they show really badly as black spots, because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads. it feels so good on though! you must be super careful with it. i have no idea how the little snags even got there!",neutral
"I'm usually a small (5'5"", 116 lbs, long torso), but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures, but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close, mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however, it is rather short, possibly because it is an x-small, and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom, which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect",neutral

"This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.

These looked super cute online and i was excited about getting them. i wanted that slightly baggy look to be able to carry them off similar to the model. so i referred to the size chart and ordered the size that said it would allow this. based on the size chart for this item...it is wrong. i should have had extra room. instead they were tight around the hips. i measured my hips before ordering and i am a seamstress....so i know where and what to measure. this is a nice quality product though...j,neutral
"This dress ran small in the arms for me. when i returned it for a bigger size, the dress i got had a huge rip in the decorative threading on the back. i can't believe the product wasn't checked for flaws this huge before shipping. i asked for another one in the same size. we'll see if it, too, is defective",neutral
"The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height,t eh other was so low, i could barely put my hand in it. however, the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice, but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs, but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size, so i let it go...

"I like this top, but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1"", and have a larger bust, 34 c. this shirt fits in the length, but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts, and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color, and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage, my bras are not covered by this to",neutral
"Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split, so any movement reveals most of your arm, shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes, i could wear a sweater or blazer with it, but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why, retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc., but the split sleeves make it a no-go.",neutral

"I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.",neutral
"After reading all the reviews, i ordered up a size. the problem isn't that it runs small. it's that they took the bodice of a true size and stuck it on the skirt of a small size. or if you want to think of it differently - the bodice of a large size on to the skirt of a true size. the 4 top with the 6 bottom would be perfect. unfortunately - you get a size 4 fitted bodice with a skirt that puckers at the back and shows all your flaws (spare tire) or a size 6 that is atrociously long in the torso",neutral

"For reference, i'm 113 lbs, with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft, comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line, it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also, it is a ""mixed-media/material"" type. for example, it's linen with soft leather accents, which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar, on the wrist area,",neutral
"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit, albeit unique, is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape, but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better.",neutral

 Very disappointed with our stay in this hotel Room was basic and didn t deserve its 4 star rating when comparing to previous hotels we had stayed in on our trip After experiencing a dreadful nights sleep due to an extremely loud drilling noise apparently coming from the air conditioning which we did contact reception about and were advised to turn it off which made no difference as the noise continued to consistently interrupt our sleep at various points throughout the night we complained when we was checking out Although the member of reception staffs manners were excellent our complaint was not taken seriously at all and was basically dismissed No details were written down or recorded and when we showed the reception staff a video we had recorded of the noise he proceeded to speak to his manager who unfortunately did not have the time or even manners to come and speak to us personally We were then offered a breakfast as compensation even though we had just walked though the breakfast room and it was being cleared away as breakfast was finished so we declined as we felt we were entitled to some form of financial compensation or discount This was not entertained or even considered by the hotel and we were given a voucher for two small drinks which was basically a joke and thrown in the bin The recording of the abrasive noise is available on request and will be attached to my reviews Overall a very disappointing and underwhelming experience in this hotel and we will not be recommending anyone to stay in a Trend hotel No Positive,bad

 The heater is very very loud and you cannot sleep when it is on I ask the reception for a solution and they promised to fix it but they never follow up it happened every night till the last night we spoken to the night manager and he himself managed to give us a portal heater what they were able to give us from the day 1 As I booked the room in non refundable rate for the first time even if I wanted to leave the hotel first day they charged then I stayed hoping for an improvement I had just one night sleep out of 4 nights stay All the furnitures got old and need to be replace for a five star hotel The floor carpet is dirty and iPod doc is still suitable for iPhone 4 No body cares about you and the worse feeling is ignorance even when I wanted to talk with morning manager at the check out he told me he is going to follow up the case and email me which they send me an email few hours after I left the hotel with the note that we checked and during your stay it was all the time the room temperature 25 but they never mentioned that if you turn on the heater for not freezing you cannot sleep because it is the noisiest The point is that I was already there and I was unsatisfied maybe I felt better if they left me an excuse note during my stay After all you will feel cold ignored stayin in a moderate facilities room it is a 3 star hotel now It was better in the past  It wasn t my first stay there then whatever I post is my experience over These years The only plus point now is location for this hotel ,bad

 Our first night was spent freezing in a room with no heating We made several complaints After receiving extra towels and a thin blanket to stay warm finally the manager came with a portable heater He was very apologetic and we did receive a discount room transfer for the second night and complimentary breakfast However the first night was very uncomfortable due to the lack of sleep and temperature I have recently been very unwell and being so cold all night was certainly not ideal No Positive,bad
 The rooms where heated up even outside temperatures where only around 15 C Rooms are tiny literally the size of the bed and noisy if you have them to the road due to old windows No Positive,bad

 We have been told lies about the free private parking facilities and most importantly didn t mention about their current refurbishment on the website To be noted that the manager and the staff were so useless I also got a penalty charge of 110 because staff gave wrong information about the parking in Manor road where I have been told to park my car during my stay there Overall it was the worse hostel I have attended in my entire life  None,bad

 The room service was very bad we requested bathrobes and slippers it took around an hour or so for it to be delivered and when the lady arrived she was pushing the items with force towards me and trying to step inside the room when I asked her not to She wasn t communicating and was very angry for some reason Second thing we ordered bed and breakfast everything we got was dry hard and the eggs undercooked So we decided to try the pastries when we found a black piece of hair attacked to the chocolate croissant It seemed like all the food was a collection of previous servings to other rooms as nothing was fresh or clean When we were checking out I was explaining this to the receptionist who didn t take note and ignored my concerns That s Why I m writing a review here I m very shocked about such service As doubletree used to be my number one pick  I like the location,bad
 Horrible staff at reception except Antonio Absolute impoliteness Passive and sometimes negative approach to the client which makes very bad impression at the end Wifi works very slow or don t works at all at some moments It s not a first time that I stay in this hotel but would try to avoid coming back here again  Good location nice rooms,bad

 I arrived Friday afternoon a Tunesian desk man began to make strange remarks about my nationality First the young desk lady didn t even look at me and helped an Indian or Pakistanian couple even I was waiting there before This couple asked all the time about parking infront of the hotel and the Tunesian guy finally said it s so expensive to park infront of the hotel as in S which is my native country It seems he worked there once and wasn t happy and even if I talked to him in fluent French he tried to respond in German The young lady was very unfriendly as well as the other one next day blond probably Russian with poor knowledge of French she was arrogant almost seemed a joke The room was not in a clean and good condition for 110 city tax A very bad location even my dog I wouldn t let go in  everthing was very very poor and nothing worth to stay there ,bad
 My expensive Video tripod head was damaged in my room while I was away for work The Courtyard Marriott did not want to take responsibility No Positive,bad
 The place itself is not kept up well my room was small and cramped little things like it was difficult to turn on the shower without getting wet with cold water because of the location and direction of the shower nozzle and the type of shower door I had two very awkward and inappropriate exchanges with staff A cleaning person opened my door while I was in the room without knocking and heeding my requests to not come in Why she was trying to enter was completely unclear Another staff member at the lobby desk tried to convince me to let him take me to the airport in his private car NOT official hotel car vehicle instead of taking a licensed taxi As a young woman I felt very suspect of his motivations I would never stay in this place again  The location was just about the best quality decent walking distance to Duomo shopping ,bad

 The put my pregnant girlfriend and I in a single room with a single bed then when we said it was a double bed they told me I didn t know what a double bed was and that was the normal double room Checking the photos on here it wasn t and they agreed to move us to the room we had paid for It seemed like a chore to move us but they made sure we slept in the room that was facing the road and had a club on our level next door Worst stay I ve ever had in a hotel  Location is handy for the Harry Potter play but I d only stay here if it was the last hotel available in London ,bad
 As the location is difficult for public transportation and far away from anything interesting the hotel offers 8 bikes BUT beware You have to give all your sensitive details including your credit card security code to get the bike When I refused the arrogant receptionist demanded 400 Euro in cash as a guarantee I was given a lecture in Spanish law for free He was also refused the talk with the manager who was not there as the hotel does not need the manager I would add it does not need clients like me  Modernised facility comfortable bed Welcome coffee service only the first night ,bad

 When we arrived we were due to pay for the hotel which was 387 as we were not able to pay upon booking We got charged over 400 which was a crafty move We also requested a double bed as we are a couple and got two twin beds It was not a busy time and feel this simple request could have been met The room itself was situated on the ground floor about 5 steps away from a school playground We had to get ready in the dark as our curtains could not be opened or all the screaming kids in the playground would be able to come watch us getting changed The lighting in the hotel room was appaling so we were mainly in darkness as we did not want people passing by or the school children peering in The noise was unbearable and the location was awful I would never recommend this hotel The cleaner did not replace the coffee and left cleaning products in the room We felt very undervalued and that we had been given the worst room in the hotel which should not be used I have nothing good to say apart from the reception had a nice smell No Positive,bad

 The whole hotel had the feel of somewhere that had been given a cheap makeover to make it look more expensive that it was There was poor attention to detail e g on arrival in room we found the fabric on the desk chair to be ripped evidence of poor quality repairs in bathroom The classic double was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in made worse by the tiny windows situated high up the wall The hotel is a labyrinth and guests are provided with a poorly designed map to navigate No Positive,bad

 It always annoyes me to arrive at a hotel and find that I have been mis lead This hotels boasts 4 and a half stars It is a 2 star hotel even by Paris standards The room was barely 9sq metres The chair could not be pulled out without hitting the bed The bed and pillows had the comfort of an autopsy table Everything about this hotel is dark cramped and depressing For nearly AU300 a night I had the right to expect much more We got out as soon as possible thanks to booking com and found a beautiful 3 star hotel in the theatre district The contrast was startling If you want to ruin your stay in Paris this place is for you otherwise keep looking  The staff we courteous and understanding The only redeeming feature,bad

 Staff at reception was rude non polite and with poor communication skills Room booked was superior triple room but was very small and can t be ranked as superior room Dinner was included in our booking and timing was till 10 30 pm at 10 00 pm serving staff refused to refill the items finished like main course fruits desserts Serving staff were very rude and unprofessional Don t have even sense how to talk to the guests To our surprise there was NO WATER in the toilet Once complained we were informed that technician is working will be fixed in 15 minutes Water was restored at midnight Kids went to bed without even brushing teeth Once awake in morning same issue no water in toilet After heated argument with the reception they provided key for room in lower level so that we use toilet and get ready to catch the flight Asked about the manager but in vain Neither met him nor they provided his mobile no Si I could speak to him Simple answer from reception Manager is not available Very bad experience last night of our vacation was ruined by glam This hotel cannot be ranked even 2 star  Location if one is interested to stay close to station ,bad

 We stopped at this hotel for just one night thankfully When we wanted to give feedback about our experience the available representative was Lara We started discussing the following points with Lara and she fully agreed with us stating I know but I have to work here When we were asked to settle the bill and complain afterwards I declined and wanted to discuss the issues now Well Lara s attitude really turned aggressive rolling eyes and all her conversation was now conducted through shouting When we asked to see the manager Lena we were told she was unavailable as on holiday Lara was able to converse with her during the time we provided the feedback but we were not allowed to talk to her Discussion points in brief The hotel was a 4 star hotel But obviously needs money and a lot of work doing to bring it to even a reasonable level certainly to our room When we checked in we were left waiting whilst Lara talked to people that arrived after us When we were trying to complain about the accommodation we were left 40 minutes whilst the maintenance man verified the state of the room and appliances that did not work The room was grubby bits broken walls and furniture had chunks out of it discoloured and in the bathroom mould due to water damage tv didn t work the kettle worked intermittently shower head didn t fix to bracket so you had to hold whilst showering freezing cold water for the sink During breakfast I asked for tomato ketchup there was none When my wife asked for semi skimmed milk for her cornflakes she was brought hot milk when asked for more cold milk for her cornflakes she was informed there was none left Hearing this Lara brought the waitress out to confirm the story she told the waitress there was milk wasn t there she was twice told they had run out before she ordered her go  The location,bad

 We certainly did not like the arrangement of the door into our bedroom should be the other way around and the telephone was not fixed after asking staff to fix it several times Several lights were out so they needed to be fixed so maybe the room is hardly used Also there was tonnes of noise down below in the streets where our no 10 room was  The hotel design was funky and original Breakfast was nice Staff friendly Gym is amazing ,good

 The shower in the bathroom was adequate and the decor a little dated in places  The room was clean and comfortable and service provided eg extra tea coffee towels and toiletries was exemplary Staff very welcoming and helpful The restaurant experience was interesting with emphasis on fine dining Short walk to the tram in lovely location ,good
 The Hotel Bar arrangement was a little unfortunate for us in that you had to walk through the Smoking section to get to the Non smoking section  The staff throughout the hotel were superb and were happy to help with any issue we had that really made the stay a great experience ,good
 Bed was a bit uncomfortable  Breakfast was nice good facilities Fantastic location ,good

 My request for a gluten free breakfast had not been noted  Friendly helpful staff ,good
 Expensive to eat and drink also too many extras ie having to pay extra for Internet breakfast spa Location,good
 The breakfast was abit basic but for a quick bite before a day exploring the city it was fine  The hotel was modern and fresh and the staff were very helpful We preferred being slightly out of the main hustle and bustle of Milan and would recommend this place to other travellers We enjoyed having a few drinks in the bar in the evening but would have liked abit of background music This hotel was also close to the tube station under 10 min walk which was a perfect way to get in and out of the city ,good
 the noise The room in not soundproof at all Can hear people coming and talking from lift like from one end of building to the other end where our rooms were  The breakfast was magnificent the pastries were divine I love breakfast I can compare with other 5 hotel and their pastries beat them I would come back just for the pastries The receptionist were so friendly and he recommended us a place for dinner and we loved it It was close by to the hotel ,good
 no complaints but not as luxurious as other hotels we ve stayed at for a similar price location,good
 Nothing I can think of We all wished we could have stayed longer  Upon arrival we were greeted by the very friendly and helpful staff at reception just as with every time we returned from going out The rooms were very clean beautifully decorated with lots of character and very comfortable The location is great with many restaurants and shopping nearby Spitalfields Market is less than 5 minutes walk away Liverpool Street station is less than 10 minutes walk ,good
 Room was very small The foyer and the style of the hotel really good for the price,good
 The trendy cosmopolitan styling wasn t really to my liking its a bit edgy and dynamic with its podium concierge desk and open plan nightclub type hotel bar area I really prefer a hotel to be more relaxing comfortable and homely A bit overpriced compared to comparable hotels in the same area I would stay there again but it wouldn t be my first choice  Staff were polite and helpful Place was clean and functional ,good
 The room was a little bit small for packing a big suitcase for onwards journey But still excellent  Great food great TV loads of nice features ,good

 The bed Four post Wasn t comfy and it made a noise everytime you moved a mm Definitely worth investing in a new one Room 22 Great location Friendly staff Nice breakfast ,good
 There were no wall hooks to hang up our jackets which was a little unhandy Because the hotel is located in zone 2 the traveltime to the city was a bit long Matresses could use an update  The room was more than enough for a perfect citytrip The make up service of the rooms was handy aswel Nice and helpfull personel Close to an underground ,good
No Negative The hotel location was perfect and they also had hybrid bicycles which were a lot of fun and I think the best way to check out the city ,good

 Cannot fault hotel on any aspect The location is just perfect for touring Paris 2min walk from the centre of Champs Elysees and metro stations Very helpful staff Small room but ok for 2 adults with luggage,good
 Breakfast was disappointing whilst the food was tasty and varied we were seated only for the table to be taken by another couple whilst we were getting our food Not sure how this came about but it led to an embarrassing situation which with better management could have been avoided The staff failed to help and the breakfast experience certainly didn t seem like value for money Definitely put me off returning In addition we wanted to eat our lunch outside because it was a beautiful day and the promotion pictures suggested that this would be a lovely thing to do but staff told us they were only serving lunch inside so we went elsewhere Couldn t help feeling that the great potential of this hotel isn t being fully realised  The location is excellent with nearby attractions and speedy links to all parts of London The reception staff who were personable and efficient added a nice sense of style to the hotel ,good

 Room service i e bed making bathroom cleaning was not finished until late afternoon which was unfortunate as I had returned to the hotel hoping for an afternoon nap before going out again in the evening I have used Booking com previously so booked again through you in rather a hurry and had obviously agreed a price I would never have accepted had I double checked I have found The Wesley to be good value for money whenever I ve stayed before but certainly not this time If we stay overnight again in London I shall try a different booking service and also other hotels  Good breakfast with plenty of choice,good

 You have to use the rather complicated footbridge DLR Poplar station to reach hotel from Canary Wharf Brand new boutique hotel 10 minutes walk from Canary Wharf Hotel had been open only 2 weeks when I stayed there It was without a doubt the most comfortable and well equipped hotel I stayed at in Canary Wharf area at a very reasonable price ,good

 Breakfast slightly cold but we were eating quite late so cant really complain However we did NOT appreciate a phonecall very late at night enquiring whether we had ordered sandwiches Im sure it was just a rare mistake but maybe it could have been done differently Took ages to get back to sleep  Beds very comfy Reception staff and generally all the staff were helpful and friendly thank you ,good
 Nothing everything was excellent and I didn t hear a single train The grumpy woman in the Metro ticket office who wouldn t accept a E50 note when I tried to buy two carnets  The location of this hotel is superb only metres away from the mainline train station Gare de Lyon and the TGV s heading west and south and the Metro Line 1 which is only a couple of stops away from exchange stations which take you anywhere in Paris Both stations can be reached without getting wet during February s drizzle The housekeeping staff are excellent they found my wife s lost earring and kept the room spotless The breakfast buffet has a wide variety of food available and everything I sampled was excellent Across from the station there are two fine restaurants I can t decide which was the better I will definitely stay there again ,good

 Air conditioning didn t work all the time Good location helpful staff,good
No Negative Excellent breakfast and comfortble rooms,good
 Had a lunchtime reservation in The Ting for a table of 9 The service was rather slow to say the least Didn t expect to have to ask for the wine list in such an establishment Surely even if it was a busy service there would be enough staff to cater for customers needs Despite this the food was very good and when we were served staff were helpful Again slow to serve in the cocktail bar all very nice however a prompt service would make the experience a better one  Fantastic spacious rooms with an amazing view of London Well worth a visit ,good

 You have to validate your parking at reception to get the discounted price of 24 otherwise you get charged 50 There was no sign by the car park machine advising of this nor did the staff advise of this at check in Was sorted though but needs to be made clearer  Very good location and reasonable price with good parking,good
No Negative Great location clean room nice breakfast buffet,good
 Food was good but not as good as the price suggests  Excellent service Very spacious clean comfortable and well appointed rooms ,good
 I missed having bathrobes and slippers I m not a fan of all in one washing liquids Multi stage lighting is a must  Although the hotel isn t in the city center connections to city center are excellent The tram stop is couple of meters from hotel entrance so you re never really far from central attractions I imagine this would be very useful for getting around the city if you re not cycling or driving neither of which are recommended for first time visitors or those who don t know their way around Amsterdam Oosterpark not to be confused with the famous Vondelpark is a 2 minute walk there are many general stores nearby to fulfill your living needs and if you re feeling peckish at 2 in the morning 24 7 room service has you covered On premise private parking was available at a reasonable for Amsterdam 27 per day The hotel has an aesthetically pleasing fa ade which some might even find grand Our high ceilinged room was spacious by European standards All my encounters with the staff were positive It is a safe neighborhood and there are some nice coffeeshops within walking distance if you want to unwind at the end of the day ,good
 What let the hotel down was although the bedroom and bathroom was very attractive it had a basic feel Open wardrobe had to ask for ironing board and iron no black tea or milk but strangely two green apples and two bottles of water Also no guest book on services For 270 a night felt it was overpriced  Friendly staff Good position close to Eiffel Tower and two metro stations Front rooms on floor five and six have Eiffel Tower views beautiful bar lounge Liked the Nespresso machine Comfortable bed great shower There was a good value room service menu although we didn t use it as plenty of caf s nearby ,good

 The room was in need of a proper clean lots of dust on top of the television and spiderwebs in one of the wall lamps The shower was almost unusable as the water pressure was very low and the shower head was clogged with limescale  The staff were friendly and welcoming ,good
 stale water smell in bathroom shower cubicle could have been smaller which would allow the toilet cubicle to be larger bedroom too modern for an old hotel  Hotel is old and has a nice comfortable feel to it Staff are excellent and the restaurant is superb ,good
No Negative Location was excellent staff nice friendly bottle of champagne on arrival for my husbands 50th birthday,good
 located adjacent to a busy road but would not put me off staying here again  The hotel was conveniently located a short walk from the metro station The room was excellent I was lucky enough to stay in a suite which was extremely well appointed clean and comfortable the breakfast offered was excellent with a wide choice of foods on offer at the self service buffet The staff were very helpful The only negative aspect was the noise from traffic on the adjacent busy highway however with the windows closed and aircon on there was no particular issue All in all a very enjoyable stay in a hotel which offers fantastic value for money,good

 The outside of the hotel looks a bit grotty but once inside it is quite fancy The seating area in the bar was nice and cosy but unfortunately smelt of fried food from the kitchens suggest they invest in a good extractor  Great location for seeing a different part of London i e Camden Market Little Venice and very close to Regents Park Very smart public rooms and compact but clean and quiet bedroom ,good
 No tea or coffee making facilities  Very convenient location great breakfast comfortable and well decorated room Friendly staff and good value price for Milan ,good
 The shower could have been more powerful also the toilet paper was rough There was also a problem with the WIFI The beds were very comfortable a fan was also provided which was great as the weather was really warm and we were on the 3rd floor which seemed extra warm The location of the hotel was also great only a short walk to the River Thames which we did a lot of our travelling by ,good

 The temperature in the room was quite hot but we ve noticed that is common in Europe Upon request the staff adjusted the thermostat for us overnight  The room was very nice large and clean WiFi worked perfectly and the staff were very friendly and helpful Convenient tram into town ,good
 The elevator had a jerky landing Also they charged me for something after I checked out and after enquiring they said its for items I had taken from the mini fridge All was ok but what I didn t like was they charged to my card even without informing and only could know after I sent a message Since I had not taken one of the item which I conveyed they were courteous to say that they will refund Could be better if they charge to credit card they also inform the customer by email at least whenever they have records with them Good location comfortable beds spacious room and value for money ,good
 It was rather disappointing that although we booked for a price by the time we ended up paying despite we had the money ready to pay when we booked we ended up paying 30 more  The staff were excellent Really helpful and polite and seemed genuinely happy Rooms were excellent too ,good
 I stayed in the single bed room I would recommend always booking the double rooms my single bed was very uncomfortable When I informed the manager the next day I was informed that I could have mentioned this and could have been relocated to another suite The adjacent attached restaurant had VERY poor service The food was good when it came but there the quality of service provided by the servers was not satisfactory they were pleasant but negligent  The location was great quiet at night and right by the tube My parents room was nice and comfortable for their bed The rooms were clean and nice Being from Canada the USB plug in was handy because I didn t need a converter to charge my phone The front desk service provided a really pleasant check in and check out experience ,good
No Negative Location and clean rooms,good
 Nothing Excellent welcome with very friendly staff would recommend this hotel,good
 We would have eaten in the restaurant one or two nights and would certainly have had breakfast but at 20 Euro each for breakfast and a son who would have 2 slices of toast it just didn t make sense  The staff were extremely helpful and unobtrusive Frank on the concierge desk was especially helpful advising which sites it would be a good idea to book tickets for in advance The hotel has an beautiful lobby and lounge and the room we stayed in was extremely quiet which certainly can t be said of another supposedly 5 star we stayed at recently We stayed in one of the refurbished rooms overlooking the city towards the sea which again was faultless and had efficient and quiet air conditioning ,good

No Negative Very polite and helpful staff 2 minutes walk to tube station Free car park on site although limited ,good
 AC was bit noisy but worked well There s a 20 min complimentary wifi available in the lobby and I was able to connect to that from my fourth floor room as well but if you need a faster connection for work and 24 7 use it costs seven pounds per day In these times when free fast wifi is everywhere I would highly recommend the hotel management to consider wifi revamp  I had booked a single room which comes without window but receptionist informed me he had upgraded me to a bigger room with window as the room type I had booked was unbearably hot Highly appreciated as the city was under heatwave Though the room was bit on the scruffy side tapestry and furniture worn out it was clean and had all basic amenities coffee tea making stuff hairdryer iron ironing board etc Safety boxes are not available in the rooms but at reception ,good
 We requested an early check in which was actually confirmed by you in an email saying it HAD been agreed we got there for half 11 to check in for 12 to be told we couldn t until 3 so had to wait around Also there seems to be a lot of noise on a morning banging doors and building works going on right over the road Food was superb,good

 We went with Easter weekend and were surprised there was no decoration or even Spring themed welcome at reception rather dull Breakfast was OK but from a 4 star hotel you would expect more service like a menu to choose your eggs from I was certainly have with the balcony room  Staff was wonderful welcoming and kind Location is SUPER ,good

 PARKING Welcome customers Please park your car in our hotel parking lot at a rate of 35 Euros per day Then every time you want to leave the hotel to get food or drive around you have to wait in line to get your ticket scanned by a member at the front desk This is so disappointing that it ruins all the great things about this hotel Its not like it s located in the best spot You need to take a 10 minute tram ride to get into town My next stay will not be at this hotel for this very reason This is making me try another hotel closer to city center RESTAURANT FOR DINER I could explain in detail but I would just say don t eat here Not worth the 20 euro markup on every dish  WIFI Fast and only free if you are a Hilton Honors member tip become a Hilton honors member before your stay it costs nothing HOTEL ROOM Room was clean shower pressure was strong Executive club access not worth the extra money its a small room at the top of the hotel and you can t step outside when up there BREAKFAST Hands down the best breakfast ever Eggs bacon sausage fruit yogurt pastries they will make pancakes omelets poached eggs all is included in the price of breakfast I highly recommend you add breakfast to your stay ,good

 Clean but very old hotel Very slow wifi Only location very old hotel,good
 We booked a triple room but the third bed was fairly uncomfortable fold up bed in a double room  The hotel is part of the Olympic village so everywhere looks quite new it s a 5 minute walk to the beach and 30 minute walk to city Staff were fab and the pool for kids was great ,good

 You always have to Ask for extra hangers And if You are Staying for one night or whole month You Just get one complimentary bottle of water I think giving a complimentary bottle of water for every night stay would be more fair Even if the bottles were smaller in size This trip the room small fridge was not cold enough but the hotel changed it in a few days and promised they will change all the fridges in the near future  Location helpful staff,good

 Room suite was much much smaller than I had expected Stylish and relaxed,good
No Negative The staff was very helpful and friendly ready to help with any questions Room was upgraded because it was my partners birthday ,good
 A little bit more luggage space in the room and a marginally bigger bathroom would have been the icing on the cake But overall very happy with overall value for money of this hotel as a base for sight seeing A shuttle bus timetable on the hotel website would have been enlightening and information telling us that there is a timetable at the airport bus stop would also have allowed us to manage our time a bit better at the airport on arrival  Loved the friendly helpful shuttle bus driver hotel staff the very efficient left luggage service The hotel bar decor on the roof top is super and classy Beds were extremely comfortable Breakfast was excellent Tram stop beside the hotel a major plus and lovely park beside hotel gave a relaxed country feel 15 minutes to the airport easy ,good
 A minor thing I didn t like the fact the lifts are quiet small especially when you have a lot of bags so people have to wait around  My first time at this hotel The hotel it self was very nice and better than what I actually thought it would be The staff was very attentive to me and my family I couldn t ask for better staff My partner had not come to breakfast yet and I was with my 1 year old and one waiter asked what I wanted so he went and got everything including my daughters breakfast I appreciated that very much I booked a queen room with a view but the room did not have a fridge so they changed my room to a suite which was much bigger had a fridge and everything It was just excellent especially for my daughter and my partner as i planned all of this for Father s Day weekend We had a lovely weekend Thank you X,good
No Negative Room was quiet,good
 Because it is so small you can hear the people in the hall easily but it was only bothersome if we were trying to take a nap during the middle of the day because of jet lag  Staff was very friendly and helpful Brought tea whenever we wanted and wouldn t accept a tip Housekeeping was very pleasant and quick yet thorough about cleaning Great location small and quiet Actually got the chance to pretend we lived there for a week rather than being tourists ,good

No Negative All staff was great and helpful Especially Lucy from reception she was the best Thank you again ,good
 The public bar of the attached pub The Rugby was on but I felt some of the clientel needed better vetting The atmosphere was not very friendly The Lounge part was night and day in comparison  The hotel was very good indeed Staff were helpful and gave a free upgrade The breakfast was excellent and location was central enough to not be too busy ,good

 Nothing Just excellent Location breakfast Room price,good
 Not enough staff on bar to cope with demand often a long queue just to get a drink Not enough seating in combined bar and restaurant area to cope with number of people staying at hotel  Great location only 2 min walk away from Wembley stadium and SSE Arena Lovely clean comfortable rooms Great value for money paid 125 per room 1 night Staff friendly and professional but were run off their feet in bar and restaurant area all the time ,good

 the hotel was undergoing some work and there was scaffolding outside our window the carpet was very threadbare  The location was central and the hotel was comfortable ,good
 Stairs no lift The place was comfortable,good
 Nothing There are great options for breakfasts close by the hotel which are much cheaper It was important for us to find smoke free places they are there if you look  The location in Leopoldplatz is a little off the beaten track but still an easy walk to the main parts of town We liked the less touristy more authentic neighborhood Liked that it was very quiet even though the area is quite busy Couldn t fault service thanks ,good

 The receptionist called Cecilia was very rude The staff except one were very helpful,good
 Still no coffee tea facilities in the room Detail our room didn t have power sockets near the bed which is easy if your cell phone serves as an alarm clock This however is not the case in every room  Very helpful and professional staff Great location 10 minute walk from the city center Extensive breakfast The rooms we got on the second floor were renovated last year when we were there and thus probably some of the best standard rooms in the hotel ,good

 The great breakfasts turned out to be 30 per person Shame on us for not asking first  Room was clean and comfortable breakfasts were great ,good
 The only thing bad I can say is I ordered breakfast to my room and the coffee portion was tiny I would of liked an option of a big pot I need this to wake up  Staff were very welcoming and nothing asked requested was to much much trouble Rooms were spotless Bedding looked new I usually hate staying in hotel beds but it was spotless so I was fine Ordered breakfast in my room They made the porridge with soya as requested and the bowl was huge gorgeous and filling Car park is UCP which is a two minute walk away ,good
 Hard bed Good location,good
 What can say Hotel prices in London are just crazy With 300euros per night you get shoebox size room single without mirror or minibar You have no space open you luggage etc Breakfast also overly expensive with dirty tableware and very limited buffet But still hotel is OK compared to some of the hotels in same area  Good location clean rooms ok service ,good
No Negative Excellent location Good aircon ,good
 Nothing  Location staff rooms,good
 Not having to go down the road to main hotel for breakfast and to pay for extras would have been nice  Great room in a central location and great range of essentials in the room ,good
 Nothing It is a fab hotel in a fantastic location  Always a warm welcome Stayed in our favourite room 345 Bar man remembered us from last year which was very impressive ,good
 But the mattress in our room for disabled person was far too deep to climb up into bed Not value for money only because we didn t make use of all the facilities available  The bed was comfortable We will come back again We ve got what s important to us ,good
 only two things really 1 the room had lots of nice facilities but no tea coffee we would have foregone the robes slippers ironing board mini bar etc just to be able to make a cup of tea 2 maybe we just didn t find it but there didn t seem to be a direct link from the car park to the hotel which would have saved some leg work with heavy bags great location beautiful room friendly staff wish we were staying longer ,good

No Negative The Portobello is warm and welcoming I had a beautiful spacious room with a great view Intimate authentic original old school My room was stunning and reminded me of Old Europe Bed was super comfortable with crisp linens and a clean modern bathroom though the size of a closet The downstairs lounge is open to hotel residents and swirling with interesting visitors from all parts of the world The included breakfast was a wonderful plus and very welcome to this weary traveler ,good
 Everything was really nice in the hotel the only little thing is that room service is until 22 00 but this isn t a deal breaker If you re hungry at night there are loads of placed around open until late  I loved my stay in this hotel it was great coming back to the hotel after long hours of walking around Vienna The hotel design is beautiful It s a beautiful space both in the room and in the common areas cafe reception hall etc Staff was super nice and very accommodating of every request providing me with good information when I needed and just generally being so nice and friendly I had a few chances to eat meals in the hotel other than breakfast and it was very nice The food was great and they had a nice selection of wines Moreover the cafe staff as well was very nice and welcoming Location is another plus it s in the old town and a few minutes walk from all the major attractions such as Stephan s dome etc If I come to Vienna again I ll definitely want to stay in this hotel ,good
 no gym room is very small very Good location Metro train station is very close by,good
No Negative Great location Clean Lovely staff,good
 It would of been courteous and far less embarrassing if the reception staff who directed me to the cocktail bar had informed me that I needed to wear a shirt this I respect but to be told in front of other guests once inside the door was embarrassing I had only just arrived and had not had time to consider the dress code The air conditioning could of been better as I could not get the room temp low enough and the Windows did not stay open Bed was comfy,good
 The small rooms are very small and expensive for the size  Location ,good
No Negative If you are going to use Gare du Nord it beats any hotel in the area ,good

 Apparently no twin rooms with windows so we had to stay in the cellar Room smelled like somebody had smoked in it sometime in the past TV screen had some technical issues everything in green and blue moving or touching the cable would cause signal issues  Breakfast offered toast crepes muffins cereal Restaurant with special offers like Happy Hour restricted choice 2 types of pizza 2 types of pasta Tesco and Starbucks right across the street Very close to underground station Kilburn Park Bed comfortable and rain shower nice Tea and coffee refilled safe in wardrobe hair dryer and even sewing kit in drawer Friendly staff they all seemed to be Italian Towels exchanged regularly Wifi worked fine passwords were exchanged every 24 hours ,good
No Negative Small hotel with great location close to museums Excellent friendly and helpful staff Our deluxe suite on the sixth floor was fine for a mature couple staying six days No trouble sleeping although just to make sure we did use the sleep noise app on our Ipad If returning to Paris will definitely check this hotel first for availability and price ,good

 some noise from the streeet nice and clean room easy to connect and fast wifi,good
 There were constructions around the hotel and it was quite noisy during the day Not major issue though as it was quiet in the night  Very nice interior and tram line stops right in front of the hotel,good
 Staff at desk seemed unhappy but we re not rude at all No breakfast facilities but places nearby so not too big a deal  Small rooms but ideal if just using for a base Right next to train station and shopping centre which was just what we needed Very clean and well decorated Expected it to be noisy but surprisingly it wasn t Would stay again ,good
 My daughter and I only stayed one night to be near St Pancras Station The hotel was good but didn t think it was worth AU500 00 for one night No Positive,good
 Sounds of the trains at night was a bit distracting  Location close to museums and restaurants Staff were always pleasant and helpful Lovely area to explore ,good
 Room 405 cigarette butts left on the window seal althou room was non smoking told the staff and the problem solved Room 610 early morning of the first night stay next room had a domestic problem and we understand the police was involved A little noisy in the area but can understand as in the centre The elevator was not working so we had to use the staff elevator  Breakfast was very good variety of foods available Desk Staff very helpful ,good
No Negative Professional stand willing to be of help not a single complaint ,good
 The free wifi was unusable for general surfing and you couldn t go back to choose the pay for option The parking was useless as there is no directions for how to park on the website They say it s onsite but you can t just pull in when you arrive as there are no signs and traffic in Amsterdam is horrendous at the best of times  The location was fantastic ,good

 The newly remodeled shower room is very nice and stylish but the water is very easy to flood out of the shower space  Very good breakfast,good
 The fact that the toilet and shower were in what felt like a cupboard Room service facilities would have been nice The breakfast on offer at the restaurant was too expensive and I thought the choice at refuel was too limited  The room had all the standard amenities The hotel itself is very modern and nicely furnished The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the shower was amazing ,good
 Be careful with the Spa They charge for sessions not attended  the breakfast a room service Top notch Great view on higher floors,good
 Closer to the centre although right next to the Metro Lovely room with balcony and loved the spa Staff were so helpful and friendly Overall stay was brilliant ,good

 Staff on desk not always quick to help I requested an iron that was never delivered Sex noises audible from adjacent room Somewhat overpriced but I guess you pay for the location  Nicely presented hotel Clean Restaurant Happy Hour Cocktails excellent value Good location Decent cafe just around the corner to avoid excessively expensive hotel breakfast ,good
 Very creaky floorboards We could hear other guests walking about their room above  The hotel was beautifully decorated and staff very friendly and helpful The complimentary drinks they provide near the main lobby were a fantastic resource after a long day exploring the city They had a good buffet selection for breakfast and the beds were super comfy Hotel was also very centrally located and within easy walking distance to most major attractions in Amsterdam The hotel also offer a taxi voucher that you can purchase for your ride back to the airport It is only slightly cheaper but still good to know ,good

 If booking com had booked our 2nd room We had to cancel a 3 bedroom and rebook a double room this was at least a few months before our travel Got the confirmation from booking com that I had 2 double rooms When we arrived at the hotel only 1 room was booked and the other room was cancelled I showed them my confirmation and the hotel was great and booked us another room but we where 3 floors away from our family I was very disappointed in booking com for this error But could not thank the hotel enough for sorting this out for us No Positive,good

 Room is so tiny Good Location helpful staff,good
 When we had selected one of the buttons on our room door so that the maid could clean it wasn t done until 2 days later  The TV had access to Netflix and Youtube for no extra cost super fast complimentary wifi We had an amazingly comfy queen size bed the room was of some of the best quality I ve experienced Really good facilities and modern and fresh hotel ,good
 The TV and remote were very complicated to use and many of the channels were not available That is my only complaint  The amazing ceiling shower head and shower and bathroom Walking distance to the train station and restaurants and to Corso Buenos Aires Modern hotel impeccably maintained very nice and professional staff Love how all the windows light up at night ,good
No Negative Great location you can reach most places on foot Friendly staff,good
No Negative Very friendly and helpful staff ,good
 If you come alone or with your girlfriend the shower could be ok but the open space and the shower in the middle of the room isn t a good choice for those who come with their friends Also the hotel is 15 minutes walk from the train station for the center area of Millan  The breakfast was ok you are free to choose Fridge in the room Tip for those who come by car it s a free large parking close to the hotel across the street ,good

No Negative Location,good
 Don t have Television Very Comfortable hotel,good
 One twin room 101 had no windows to look out of they were high and frosted Lack of choice on hotel restaurant munu The bar was quiet but still a long wait due to barman making cocktails for restaurant customers Will book again but eat and drink elsewhere  The hotel was clean and comfortable the junior suite was good value and made the trip extra special Was no noise heard from other guests will be booking again Some good places to eat close to hotel and tube station on doorstep ,good

No Negative Very good service and always smiling staff ,good
 I would have liked to have a snack or bar menu available rather than a restaurant menu I wanted a light bite before going out and this was not possible it was all large courses A toastie or a salad but this was absent on their menu  It was within walking distance to the Heineken Music Hall which is why I was there Modern clean very good breakfast Well fed with public transport easy to get to from Schipol,good
 WIFI connection was very slow and it was hard to get work done  Rooms are newly refurbished and quite small but very well designed and organised with a space for work Staff was very attentive and friendly Shower is great ,good
 The bed was nice and big however it was 2 mattresses put together and quite uncomfortable for a couple to sleep on If I wanted to sleep in a separate bed I would have booked a twin The parking I said was a bonus has an extremely cunning system They have an overnight rate of 15 but the catch is you have to leave the car park by 9am The luxury of parking your car until checkout which is only 2 hours later will cost you an extra 6 which I thought was a little excessive  The hotel room was lovely and spacious and the view was beautiful The bar sits on the river and is extremely tranquil It s a bonus that they have parking and the staff are very pleasant and polite ,good

 Wifi was not great on first stay end of July as it dropped out all the time but this was much improved on our August stay Reception did say that they were looking to change their provider to improve on this Beds are comfortable good quality but a little bit hard even though we like firm beds Would be ideal if this hotel had a swimming pool  Excellent location easy walk from to Aerobus stop Metro and hoho buses Superb breakfast hard to beat this one Large quiet room 708 very good Good walk in shower with strong water pressure Helpful pleasant staff Easy walk to the shopping centre on playa d espanya good view from the top of the centre to Montjuic and good spot for a cocktail at sundown Magic Monjuic fountains very short walking distance and worth seeing ,good
 Be very careful as they won t let you in without showing the original card you booked with Mine was a business card and I don t carry it with me Never had this problem before I did suggest that if someone subsequently came to claim our pre booked room they could turn us out but no I had to repay and then hopefully get refunded Nightmare No Positive,good

 Bathroom had an awful smell during all our stay Few ants where walking in our room too Restaurant food had huge variety but no flavor what so ever Ugly empty buildings in the area  Breakfast had big variety but the flavor of it was average Good price and close to metro station only 7mins away Free and easy parking to access ,good
 The soap which was provided in all the hotel in overpowering smelling like a man s aftershave and not a good one  The breakfast was great A cold table to choose dairy products musli and some cold cuts Then a menu with a selection of hot plates made for you like for example the italian which was eggs benadict on a bed of bacon served on a bread which was very good Staff very helpful ,good
 breakfast too expensive location,good
 It took some time to have warm water No windows into the room Location,good
 There was a bit of a wait at check in due to many customers arriving at once but staff were pleasant throughout  The public transport links are excellent the stop for tram 12 is directly outside the hotel and by transferring to the number 13 or 14 tram we reached the stop for Anne Frank house in about 20 minutes Friendly helpful staff Clean comfortable rooms and easy parking ,good
 Nothing really had a great weekend Nothing not to like Oh sorry my Son ordered food on his return to his room he had burger and chips and put it on my bill Not your fault except he said he couldn t pay as the rooms were on my card Hey Ho that s life  It was our wedding anniversary and we had an upgrade room a bottle of wine and basket of goodies accompanied by a card lovely touch It was very private the staff were available but never in your face tea and coffee making facilities to help yourself a good extra and water on tap outside rooms perfect Didn t have breakfast but will do next time Lincolns in field is a lovely area aim for the seven star pub the cat with the ruff around its neck And we were lucky enough to catch the naked cyclists parade Went to the theatre had a ball ,good

 The general ambiance of the hotel was pretty poor for a 4 hotel the elevator was at least 15 20 years old the doors have a classic key and the sliding bathroom door didn t close properly  It was easy to access and had a large parking place Also it was close to the Autobahn and the breakfast was good enough ,good
 Breakfast not included Locatio location location,good
 The breakfast seating was a bit haphazard but in retrospect I suppose it was a very busy weekend as the London marathon was on and the hotel was full The choice of items on the menu could have been better  The Primo bar was excellent and the vegetarian platter was delicious it was overall a very relaxing place to dine and relax after touring London,good

 There was a long que for breakfast in front of the dining room The bed was not comfortable  Buffe Breakfast was Big selection ,good
 The single room although they said they had upgraded it to their largest single for my birthday was still but rather small and claustrophobic very hot You would not want to linger too long in that confined space I loved the hotels history and its sumptuously embellished original features especially the theatre bar where I met my three guests who had also booked suites with you for champagne to celebrate my birthday and your amazing staircase It was good value for money and Its location was central close to the tube station and perfect for exploring Kensington Gardens and palace and the Royal Albert Hall The staff were very friendly and accommodating and had left me chocolates and a fruit basket for my birthday and did not make a charge for breakfast ,good

 There was no staff at the pool  The breakfast was very good ,good
 Not anything I would complain about As stated the rooms are small but still comfortable The furnishings are newer and everything well maintained And no smaller than you would find in similar hotels on the continent You just have to plan a bit when two are trying to get ready at the same time  The staff at this hotel were brilliant and looked after our every need The prosecco and chocolates in the lobby were a nice touch I call the hotel rooms small my partner says they are bijou Not sure but Americans need to understand these are European sized rooms Bathrooms were sufficient size and the rainwater shower was brilliant Every part of the hotel was clean modern and tidy The location in the west end is second to none On the hotel side of the street is Soho on the other side of the street is Chinatown Everything you need is in easy walking distance ,good
 complimentary waters in my room standard of the room was first class,good

 The room was far too hot and although we called reception for advice we were told that 19 degrees was as cold as it could be In fact reception the next day said that this was not so The coffee at breakfast was unpleasant The property was well located the staff were welcoming the shower was modern and everything was clean ,good

 We were very happy nothing to dislike  Beds were very comfortable and room was very clean ,good

 The room was relatively small and the hotel corridors feel somewhat old From the several fire proof doors I see along the way to my room perhaps the management think there is some risk of that The bed had a dent in the middle as though they d combined two beds into one  The location of the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with charming cafes and good local food nearby There is a theatre down the street too The staff were helpful and gave us good recommendations on what to eat The exterior of the hotel has an old school charm I reckon was an old hotel that has been refurbished ,good

 Typical of London our room was small Maybe it saved space but there was only bed side lighting on one side of the double bed The grout in the bathroom looked mouldy in places Almost felt like getting stuck into it with the White King and and a tooth brush  The location close to the Gloucester Rd tube station on the Picadilly line for ease of access to Heathrow is very convenient Also lots of casual eateries close by Nice foyer and public areas We got a good early bird pay in advance rate ,good

No Negative Love the location Very central to places of interest and attractions either within walking distance or just a bus tube train ride away Victoria Station was just opposite the hotel Wicked the musical a stone throw away and lovely cafes and restaurants nearby ,good
 not closet to ATM machine and no ATM machine in hotel no late night food options close by no pharmacies or convenience stores close by either Breakfast spread was excellent Drinks at bar were great Outside bar was very nice ,good

No Negative The location was excellent The front desk Manager Mario went above and beyond to be helpful He is definitely an asset to this hotel Breakfast was wonderful and the staff in the breakfast room were very helpful and pleasant I would definitely stay here again Again thank you Mario for all your help ,good
 I didn t like the fact that the breakfast was not included Also the hotel is a little bit far from the city centre  I liked the facilities the room and the staff Everything was amazing ,good
 steep steps into swimming area steam room needs updating Parking for guests overpriced very friendly and well informed staff too many to pick out an individual,good
 late at night the walk from the tube to the hotel might be a bit weird might be better if you travel with at least another person it s only a 1 min walk Very comfortable rooms I loved the bed close to the airport and to the tube station You were in city center in aprox 10mins Amazing breakfast loved the ricotta cheese and the watermelon tastier than in UK ,good

 Nothing to mention We just love the great welcoming and hospitality that the staff offer ,good
 Nothing I was completely happy with everything  Fabulous view Easy to get to on the bus from Euston station Very pleasant friendly receptionist Breakfast was an extra 12 00 each but we were seated in a very nice quiet cool part of the breakfast room and there was a good choice of hot and cold breakfast foods Bed was very comfortable and best of all we could open the windows and because it was on the river side of the property it was quiet overnight Excellent choice of eateries nearby for dinner ,good
 Stairs at the hotel entrance but that s common in Amsterdam  Great location clean and new facilities ,good
 Shower pressure a little weak Very clean and tidy staff brilliant,good
 My only disappointment was poor shower pressure 3rd floor and decor on some floors is tired  Excellent friendly staff team 2 double beds as per US if only all hotels in UK were like this Great facilities parking for London hotel Good breakfast cleanliness ,good
 the hotel is comfortable and we recognise that it is in an expensive area of London and our stay was at a weekend but we felt the rate charged was rather over the top for what was offered especially as it cost an extra 15 pp for breakfast convenient location for our family party the flexibility of breakfast room lounge area to sit in for extended breakfast quality of breakfast good with a good choice of food,good
 The room is quite dark Would like prefer more lighting Prefer a neutral colored corridors  We liked the firm mattress Also like the extra shelves space in the bathroom for toiletries ,good
No Negative Comfortable stay convienient for business in North London and friendly staff,good
 the breakfast sucks I would have expected an english breakfast Insted there was bread and butter WITH NO HAM or SALAMI Some bananas milk This is NOT a real breakfast IT s a JOKE VERY VERY POOR Everything else was excellent  The staff was super friendly And professional No noise perfect for resting ,good
 Shower Water running to the floor if not careful The Bed was really comfortable The tv nice and big,good
 The shower was a bit slow in delivering hot water in the morning  What a gem Ideally placed for Paddington commuters rooms exceptionally clean and well equipped After a warm welcome I was given a free upgrade on arrival the room was compact but big enough for a short stay everything was new and worked and the bed was really comfortable ,good
No Negative Very friendly staff Welcome drink on arrival Breakfast amazing choice ,good
 Softer bathroom robes Standing in the shower was very slippery Not having a mirror in the bedroom  The executive lounge The pillows in the bedroom The spa The staffs friendliness and helpfulness Location of the hotel near the metro ,good
 Although the room was nice the double bed was more like a three quarter  Nice hotel two minutes from the Metro and ten minutes walk to the Seine Smallish room but perfectly adequate Friendly helpful staff Nice breakfast with real orange juice as opposed to the awful squash most hotels serve The pool looks great but we didn t have time to use it ,good
No Negative Very nice rooms clean new very good design The location of the hotel is excellent there are many restaurants bars and shops nearby city center is a short walk away Free coffee and beverages in lobby are also nice addition ,good
 Costly Excellent,good
No Negative super clean and well located,good

 The price for the room was high I stayed here based on the recommendation of a friend I would probably have chosen to stay elsewhere were it not for their recommendation And the breakfast was typical for the other hotels I used on my trip where the rooms were quite a bit less  The location and the hotel itself the room and the common areas ,good
No Negative The room is beautiful staff so lovely and helpful gave us a map to get around town helped to order us taxi on nights out always spoke to us and showed genuine interest The breakfast was lovely The hotel location is great literally 10 mins from city by metro and like 4 minute walk to the local station ,good
 The fact that there was dirty stinky socks in a cupboard And view to the train station Room was amazing and access to tv movies music our lil kitcen area too ,good
 N a Ideal location for us because my husband was taking part in the Amsterdam Marathon,good
 Nothing Beautiful hotel with excellent and helpful staff Breakfast was good self service so you can eat as much or as little as you like Served on the 8th floor nice view Rooms are excellent and plenty storage space This was my favourite hotel in my little stay in Italy Good public transport in Milan and this hotel is only a short walk to the Yellow Line Metro Underground ,good
 The food in the restaurant probably one off On the whole satisfactory  We liked the accommodation the breakfast was good Didn t like the food in the resturant the chicken dish was overcooked and my wife find it very hard to chew The manager offered another alternative dish free of charge My fish n chips was very good ,good
 1 The shower has a fixed head and temperature too fiddly to adjust Would have appreciated an adjustable shower head 2 Not enough tea bags in the room 3 TV in bed room difficult to operate  Friendly and helpful staff responsiveness to our enquiries and and requests Appreciated the complimentary water in the room Breakfast was perfect ,good

 The reception was open only between 9 12 and 13 17 We had a flight at night and checked out from the room Therefore our luggages were in some special room and we hadn t got the key So you can t expect a personal who is at the reception all the time  The location was perfect ,good
 I think the room service could have been better our bed sheets were not changed for the entire time we were there  We recently got married and stayed here and absolutely loved it was amazing breakfast was really nice and fresh the view was beautiful and everything was always tidy and clean we will be coming back here again,good
 Tiny TV in the room9,good
 hard bed and the drinks prices in the bar were too high but then a service charge was added which i was told that i could have removed but after i had paid great location and really nice room easy to find from the tube in pimlico,good
No Negative service location,good
No Negative The best part about the property is the location The hotel is literally connected to the local train service which is only 40 minutes from central London You can walk from the hotel lift to the train in roughly 2 minutes The amenities in the hotel itself were brilliant and exactly as they look in the pictures The gym is 24 hours along with a snack area and reception The pool doesn t shut to 11pm and the bar stays open till 12 What more could you want from a fantastic location and amazing property ,good
 Nothing  From the welcoming to the check out we were treated extremely well Javinta at reception was extremely friendly and a great ambassador of the hotel ,good
 Room was very small with two large travel suitcases it required moving cases around each day There was barely enough floor space to open a case on the floor You get what you pay for but if you re travelling with someone ensure you upgrade or be prepared for some minor fuss  Excellent staff clean rooms quality finishings Great location close to historic bistros ,good
 We felt that the fact that resturant was closed on Friday night was bit of a inconvenience as would have been nice to have had meal in hotel as we were tired from travelling and they only options was nuts also bar bill was a bit pricey when we only had couple of drinks each  I found reception staff very friendly and also very helpful always smiling We also liked the fact that hotel felt very secure as u had to use key card to get entrance into each floor ,good
 Nothing Every thing,good
 Like all It was incredibly I have 7 girl friend all around the world for my 40th birthday magical ,good

 location but the metro wasnt too far away to take us to the city center cleanliness value of money most of the staff,good
 Reception experience was appalling both on check in and check out not the standard expected No coffee machine in my room and a lot of the room extras were missing eg plate of sweets toiletries  Lovely room comfortable bed friendly doormen and bar staff,good
 Nothing Very nice hotel ,good
 Internal rooms are good value but not having a window to the outdoors feels a little claustrophobic If you are just using as a base it s fine and it was made clear at booking Breakfast was much better from room service than in the dining room The hotel was busy so we were I think in the conference facility which felt a bit institutional  Brilliant location clean and comfortable room and great range of facilities,good
 Unfortunately we were woken up in the middle of the first night of our stay by a funny noise that sounded like a drill I rang and reported it but they were unsure what it was then later the fire alarm went off We had to all leave and as we were sent back to our rooms it went off again This was unfortunate because the same thing happened to us in a different one of your hotels last year  Everyone was very helpful and friendly The location was fantastic for what we wanted and the room was comfortable ,good
No Negative spot on hotel with great and helpful staff The Waiting staff a delight and could not do enough to help special mention to a lady who was working on Saturday night and in charge of the restaurant she went beyond the call of duty to make sure we were looked after and comfortable thank you very much and so sorry I did not get your name ,good

 The only reason that I rated the facilities as good rather than excellent was because I didn t have time to use any of them Fabulous hotel  This is a great hotel Staff were excellent and extremely helpful Room was very comfortable and spacious Lovely special touches like carol singers round the Christmas tree in the evening ,good
 very very thin walls you can hear everything from neighbors The water at the shower is fluctuating from cold to warm depends on the position of your hand  Excellent location very closed to Central Station which is very important because as tourist not much to do in Milan but very nice places around to be visited i e Como The bad sheets were changed daily very very clean in the room warm enough space excellent breakfast excellent cappuccino and very nice ladies serving the breakfast ,good

 We needed a meeting room to interview a candidate but we had to do so in the loby which worked out fine because it was a quiet period but would of been nice to have some privacy  The atmosphere is very calm and homely The breakfast is very well assorted and it is lovely to be able to help yourself to a the drink at any time as if you were at home ,good
 No amenities nearby Quite a walk to main train station and nearest metro station  Balcony connecting 2 rooms Decent breakfast spread ,good

 It was not possible to switch off the air conditioning The carpet below the beds hadn t been hoovered for some time otherwise the room was clean and newly renovated There was some noise because of the renovation but only as of 9 am The room delivery boy was unpleasant all other staff extremely friendly The swimming pool water very warm and the pool is not deep enough to do a proper swim good for relaxation only s The room was spacious with two comfortable double beds and a small balcony Huge tv good wifi The shower was excellent The staff was very friendly and helpful except for the room delivery boy who was fed up by the fact that he didn t get a personal tip in addition to the obligatory 5 pound service fee that I had to pay The gym was nice and had very flexible opening hours I was impressed by the way the hotel kindly remembered my birthday celebration Thank you very much ,good
 It was very noisy in the street in the middle of the night I wonder if the noise is from the collection of waste rubbish or some kind of road work  Receptionists are good in English and helpful Breakfast is great Free coffee tea and snacks are provided in the sitting room of the hotel Good location and close to Central Station ,good
 Beds too hard very bad sleep all 3 nights Bed kept sliding away from wall Location excellent room very clean,good
 Could ve been something in the windows between the curtains and the glass Not necessarily net curtains etc but something Felt like I had to keep lights on and curtains shut even during the day  Shower was fancy rooms had everything in that you d expect Clean comfy and fancy bedside lights too I enjoyed staying there and it was close enough to everywhere I needed to get to ,good

 There was a problem with my breakfast reservation I reserved it after the hotel so that might have been a problem to their system Before I went to the hotel I called to make sure it was added to my reservation I was told it is sorted it wasn t At check in i was told it is sorted it wasn t In the morning when i showed up for breakfast i was told that my name isn t on the list and i have no breakfast reservation Obviously it wasn t sorted But I have the feeling this is booking s mistake not the hotel s Perfectly placed in the heart of Barcelona May look poor at first because the reception is somehow cornered and very dull but overall the hotel is clean comfortable and the corridors smelled nice which is important for me ,good
 Not much  Great location great hotel rooms were perfect,good
 Couldn t open the windows in the room without calling reception so meant it was a bit stuffy and overheated in winter  Excellent location in Bank with plenty of transport links Easy to find from Moorgate or Bank tubes Large room in a quiet location especially loved the large bathroom with huge tub ,good
No Negative Bed very comfortable All staff very welcoming and friendly Bar staff excellent very helpful I would stay here again ,good
 We had a room with a reception view The halls in a hotel and walls in our room should be painted again They look dirty now I expected better cleaned room  Nice bathrooms Great garage Big lobby ,good
 Breakfast ma tre d needs further customer service training Breakfast room which doubles as the bar is extremely stark and functional with harsh lighting Poor service at breakfast with lack of crockery and cutlery The bar was closed on our return from the West End Some rooms VERY small for 2 adults  Very good location and most of the staff are exceptionally polite and helpful Very clean and rooms are comfortable and well equipped ,good
 Room was very small no where to do hair and make up no drawers to put anything away and very little hanging spaceNo Positive,good
 There is not much closet space to hang your clothes The room can become noisy when people pass by in the hallway outside your room The room is quite warm by default 24 degrees celsius and it is difficult to adjust the temperature with the thermostat  The hotel is comfortably located near the tube for those relying on public transport and also near a small supermarket for those who want to buy small groceries The room is spacious has good facilities iron hair dryer coffee tea kettle and comes with large windows that provide a nice view of the area The bed is comfortable good sized and there are both soft and firm pillows to choose from The shower is clean and there are good well sized towels The staff is friendly helpful and efficient ,good

 bathroom very small bed extra comfy location unbeatable lobby very cosy and spacious Staff very nice,good
No Negative Staff was friendly helpful and the room was really good ,good
 Cold behaving of the reception s staff by totally relaying to the automated check in system and invoice sending via email Moreover I was unhappy with very unusual practice of charging of my Master card immediately during the check in but the invoice I received via email 2 days later and 5 hours after I left the hotel The invoice was confusing with several unclear items but unfortunately I couldn t complain since I was already 5 hours away from the hotel In addition they charged my Master card with correct amount but 4 times in smaller chunks where 3 time in Euro currency and 1 time in HRK currency This was very confusing to me once i got Master card listing from my bank  Very creative design of the hotel in the industrial style It is impressive and beautiful Clean room very good breakfast WiFi worked with no issues ,good
 Horrendous watering down of fruit juice at breakfast Ridiculous in a hotel of this standing and very tight fisted  Friendliness of staff,good
 Top floor was a bit of a huff and puff wouldnt recommend if you have bad health would request a lower floor as there is no lift  Very modern and simple,good
 The hotel is not signposted off Hangar Lane so it is difficult to find an entrance off a huge roundabout  Hotel Staff,good
No Negative Nice size room very good location for euro star We did not stay for breakfast but the best part was the small but very well designed bathroom,good
 The Bar seemed to close very early on the Saturday night which was a bit of a pity we were given 10 minuted to get our last orders in and when I got up 2 minutes late to order our drinks we were told the time was up and the barman closed a rail in my face We then spoke to the Barman who agreed to serve us our last drinks as there were a few people also in our predicament However it did put a sour taste in our mouths as it was our first night there and the following night we went to another pub instead  We booked a room without a window but we were put in a lovely room with a window so we were delighted about that The fact the view showed over some construction didn t deter us as we were not expecting any view at all The room we were given was also larger than we were supposed to have gotten so that was an extra perk and especially because the price made it extra value The staff were lovely and welcoming on check in and it was just a pity that the staff in the bar were not as welcoming The view sitting the Bar was really lovely as it sat right out onto the waterside which was really nice in either the morning or evening time to sit and relax ,good
No Negative friendly helpfull Service staff is well aware of guests expecations ,good

 Basic hotel Would have liked an extra chair or stand for luggage  Great location Safe neighbourhood Close to airport and easy access to train station and tourist hop on hop off bus route 15 min walk to Catelonia square Roof top pool is a great plus with wonderful views Staff very helpful Clean Great value ,good
 Should pay extra for Gym and Wifi I believe these are essentials for a 4 stars hotel and nowadays and should be provided for FREE Location is very good staff is friendly price was great for this part of London,good
 The hotel did not have any facial tissues in the room when Hollywood stars need to wipe off their mascara The breakfast was really nice and the selection was acceptable however more fruits and vegetables and cheeses should be added to the tray The hotel has an amazing eclectic design inspired by 50 s Hollywood that reflected in every detail of the design The staff were extremely friendly and helpful ,good
 The kettle kept for tea n coffee in the room did not have a ready plug point near where it was kept and had to be moved around the room for switching on  They were perfect,good
 3 items we have shared with the hotel GM shower design is missing a door and the floor of the tolilette gets messy the hair dryer is very old and the variery of TV channels for sure must improve to have a better variety of global channels especially for kids  It was our first time in this hotel my brother recommend it to us and in general I beleive that it was a great choice Food cleaninless service general condition ventilation and natural freshness of patio breakfast good enough and rooms good size for small kids Location of course is perfect ,good
No Negative The staff were friendly and the service was wonderful Nothing was to much trouble The rooms were well equipped and the shower wet room was fantastic with lovely toiletries Beds were very comfortable and long enough as my husband is very tall The all day buffett was very welcome with a good variety We didnt use the lounge room across the corridor as we were busy sight seeing but this is ideal for a family with children who need their own space ,good

 We were not happy that our 15 year old son could not use the swimming pool after 11am Despite having explained that he is a sensible teenager nearly six foot tall training to be a life guard Therefore quite able to look after himself  Room service was prompt and excellent nothing was too much trouble The travel phone provided was a welcome support around London Thank you,good
 The rooms were slightly small as international travellers we had a big and small bag each but nowhere to have them open  The location was perfect across the road from Central station a 10 min walk from the Adam Square and shopping area as well as the Red Light district ,good
No Negative It s location and the cleanness The staff is friendly ,good
No Negative All round superb Location staff facilities All first class ,good
 The Hotel itself was great some guests were rather loud in the patio area which acts like an amplifier because of the architecture of the Hotel The laughs and shouting could be heard right up to the seventh floor where we were I did not complain as it was Easter and people were on holiday but shouting between balconies was not acceptable especially in the era of mobile phones This is not the Hotel s fault though This is due to disrespectful and in many cases drunk people s fault Although this shouting did not last too long my friend played Mozart on the violin from the sixth floor balcony all the shouting stopped I reckon everyone thought it was coming from the heavens  The staff were attentive to all our needs and requests The duty managers Daniel and Jean Phillipe were very helpful and gave a lot of their time to make sure we had a comfortable and relaxing stay The maids were polite and always wearing a smile The staff at the North Hall restaurant were particularly welcoming they granted us the table we chose and were a joy to speak to and the service was excellent Thank you to the manager Balasz and a special thanks to Alexi Deya Coco Lilly and to all the waiters And to the chef too The food was excellent We did not try the other restaurant of the Hotel as it was closed for Easter but we will soon as we ll definitely be re visiting the Corinthia Jason Clemence Nicole at the front desk were all very helpful It s the people who make a Hotel and full marks to the staff at the Corinthia for making us feel very welcome No staff had name tags but I remember their names because they connected with us in such a welcoming way on a daily basis that we remembered their names now that s a sign of how comfortable and memorable our experience was Kristina thank you for making us feel so welcome in the patio area and for the blanket The spa is something my wife used so she d be best qualified to give an opinion Unfortunately she went during child hours so it was a bit noisy But the times are clearly displayed on arrival on your TV screen and in booklets so no excuse there I did meet Michelle from the spa and look forward to using the spa when we go back My wife and I had a haircut styled by Ricky and Alex who were both excellent and fun to be with We talked so much that before we knew it our hair was done Overall great credit must go to the staff of this Hotel we will be returning for sure and we will be staying in one of the penthouses for a real special occasion ,good
 Very small thing I m short the side of the tub shower combo was a bit tall to climb over  The staff are extremely friendly helpful There are nice extras in the room like robes with slippers a mini fridge The location is exceptional right in the heart of the Latin Quarter St Germain des Pres neighborhoods Beds were very comfortable the air conditioning worked like a charm ,good

 Was Ok but nothing stands out particularely Excellent location Everything was OK nothing to highlight,good
 I have no complaints The hotel has been transfrormed since we stayed there about 20 years ago It is beautifully appointed The room we stayed in was very large The toilet was separate from the bathroom a distinct advantage The staff were polite and helpful Although the hotel is not centrally located it is very easy to travel to the centre by the nearby underground train service in just a few minutes The entrance to the grounds of Schonbrunn Palace is diametrically facing the hotel I would not stay anywhere else if I were to visit Vienna again ,good
No Negative room is small but comfortable and peaceful breakfast is always no changes the location is good however the taxi for airport is so expensive ,good

 We were staying during New Year and were not aware of the amount of people who would be in the hotel We were awake until 4am due to music in the SkyLounge When we arrived we received fresh hot cookies which was an added bonus The staff were very helpful The location cannot be faulted,good
 The breakfast is over priced We knew this going in yet traveling with a baby with no other breakfast options nearby it worked out well for us We did enjoy the selection yet just know that you are paying a lot for what you get although if like us it is more convenient I am sure you will find something you like  The location was perfect for us quiet yet an easy quick bus ride to the city The room bed was very comfortable with good light The coffee machine was an added bonus The pool area looked like it would have been great fun if it hadn t rained our entire time there Would return,good
 Difficulty checking in No iron in room When provided with Iron it tripped the electrics Location,good
 The only thing I had mixed feelings about was the breakfast buffet it had a great selection but was a little pricey  I loved that this was right above the sants estacio train station and near a main bus hub so literally we could go anywhere The hotel staff was friendly and the hotel was very tidy and clean I also really liked the space theme ,good
 Nothing really  Short stay so cant say too much but impressed with what we experienced ,good
  Breakfast location quiet room,good
 No elevator in third floor Only 100 metres to st pancras,good
 Against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best 4sq m As a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long A final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there  Overall this is a nice hotel with some plusses a beautifual old style entrance hall and bar and equivalent large rooms for breakfast the staff is efficient and very courteous the breakfast buffet is quite reach ,good
 Not even a bottle of water in the room At these prices I expect one Location Central but quiet,good
 Expensive parking Location,good
 The mattresses are twins and while sleeping at night it has the tendency to get separated apart  Everything,good
 Would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room Otherwise all good  Proximity to train station metro and airport shuttle Decor was very interesting and we liked its effect Good breakfast Restaurants nearby Cafe Pirelli Nouvo next door was a gem and had great happy hour with very jovial proprietor Quiet room even though area was busy Easy metro access to city center ,good
 The beautiful pool terrace was in the shade all day and no drinks facility available The pool was icy cold There was MOULD growing on both jugs of lemonade and iced tea in the gym The hot water coffee machine was painfully slow which made the tea lukewarm by the time it had filled the pot The step up and down from our room 702 was very high and in fact dangerous if it was dark or wet The late check out facility could be managed better I asked the question about a late check out on booking the hotel and never received a response When asking at the reception 24 hours before checkout I could not get a yes or no answer Eventually we had checkout at 1pm instead of 12 noon but couldn t confirm this until 9am on the day which isn t very helpful  Both rooms 404 702 were beautifully clean and well maintained The beds were comfortable although very tightly tucked in making it difficult to get under the covers Afternoon snacks were generous tasty and very welcome Great location for central Barcelona La Rambla shopping tours cafes etc Beach was not so close but cheap in a taxi ,good

No Negative Excelent location Very confortable,good
 The size of the room has nothing to do with what is advertised The room did not have even 16m and it was advertised for 26 fact which I find not honest The furniture in the room is very old with old windows I asked for a silent room and got one facing the street although there are rooms facing the garden as well No adaptor in the room although it was obvious that we were from outside England It was provided following our request stil Why not make it easier and offer it in the room There were 2 pieces of hair in the shower otherwise very clean The heating system is old and noisy  Very good breakfast nice area only a few minute walk from the underground a lot of nice cafes and places to eat nearby,good

 There seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and Booking com We arrived on Christmas day and the hotel was fully booked Upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though I specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children I even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this The staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue Eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the 14th floor which was great The troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast  Overall we had a very good experience The location is quite good 2 min walk from the London eye across the bridge from Big Ben it is very clean and comfortable The staff is very friendly and helpful They literally saved our trip see the cons part Bottom line Very good experience,good

 Location little bit out of center but with bus metro or free hotel s shuttle bus you can get on Doumo in 20 min  Hotel was great room was clean when we got there and the other day when we were out room it was cleaned and bedsheets changed Free wifi lcd tv Staff was excellent and very polite breakfast was one of the best I ever had full of everything and they keep bringing more also there were fresh juice s and marmalades Surely will visit again ,good
 The air con was not very effective It didn t matter to us because of the time of year and weather but in the height of summer it could be an issue because the room gets the sun all afternoon  For such a central location I thought it was good value for money ,good
 The car park for your guests was very disappointing making it necessary to spend extra on parking  Staff very friendly rooms clean comfy ,good
 Nothing can be better Confortable and clean,good
No Negative Really appreciated the extra personal touches from the staff which helped us celebrate our mini honeymoon ,good
 The prices were very high in the bar for drinks as well as the breakfast which was 50 for 2 or 25 each This priced us out the breakfast which was not ideal as we did not want to pay that figure The mini bar in the room and its contents were expensive so we did not partake in these particularly for a can of coke or 4 finger kitkat so that was a bit frustrating A small 350ml bottle of wine Chardonnay was 25 from the minibar which equates to about 2 medium glasses so 12 50 a glass Overall good price for the room of 132 but some of the extras were expensive  The facilities and room were extremely good clean and no expense spared on any of the fixtures and fittings The sky bar was very impressive on the 18th floor with the views of the river Thames and city skyline ,good

 The breakfast was not worth even half the money we paid Very poor  Very nice views from 9th floor windows open fully allowing fresh air Very clean bathroom first time I d have felt comfortable to have a bath in a hotel bathroom didn t have the time though ,good
 the wifi was very bad in our room barely connected the shower facilities are perfect the water is so strong ,good
No Negative Proximity to Lords cricket ground ,good
 Bit of a drain smell in bathroom but a couple of puffs of deodorant and gone  So central staff friendly and lots to have at breakfast and great coffee ,good
 First experience at their restaurant was not good 6 for a bottle of water is extortionate Cheaper to drink wine than water is an insult when wine is not an option pregnant Faux pas  i love this hotel and stay here every time the price allows when I am in Amsterdam,good
 No complaints  The location couldn t have been better in terms of ease in getting to CDG airport hotel is across the street from the Air France bus 4 Nice big hotel Rooms are good sized for Paris breakfast room is pleasant and airy food choice is good enough service is friendly and the little gym was an added plus Good location in Paris as well ,good

 Breakfast service was a little disorganised Despite significant advertising of cocktails available in bar on the two nights we were there none available as they had been very busy and sold out during day for 2 days running unexpectedly  Proximity to Paddington station and several very nice restaurants in close walking distance Lovely comfortable clean quiet bedroom well furnished and good TV Very pleasant and efficient reception staff Very good quality breakfast ,good

 We ll typical of London hotels Small rooms though it s a 4 star Bathroom dilemma no shower curtain the glass division was soo small thats why when u take a shower the whole bathroom is wet There s a smell stink but tolerable this matter was brought to the attention of the management They offer us to transfer to other room we we re at the basement then  Location wise very accessible to public transport near hyde park kensington park The Staff were all accommodating The hotel itself tells a lot of History Breakfast buffet is excellent ,good
 Only a small thing but airport pickup is a little confusing just walk STRAIGHT through the ground floor car park and the pickup point is right there opposite the last parking bay  Great location for airport layover Great service pickup and return to airport We had a good snack meal at night and the breakfast was great all you need and more Staff most helpful Good clean bedroom with nice bathroom ,good
 Had a regular check out at 1 pm and an evening departure to the airport but could not access the showers without paying 4 EUR for a towel after checking out  Awesome beds good breakfast with fresh made orange juice ice cold Cava hot and cold food choices Nice Danish pastries It is 10 minutes walking to the beach and a couple of restaurants with high class in the neighbourhood Close to the subway to get to the city Not crowded at the pool and a VERY nice Spa ,good
No Negative Very nice tech hotel staff were friendly and helpful Good location easy access to airport 10 min or Central Station with tram 5 ,good
 The fact that wifi costs 20 pounds per day for booking com customers as opposed to clients that book directly After two nights and much insistence they gave it to me for free but it is not right  The rooms are spacious and modern ,good

 Bed pillows  Friendliness of staff was impeccable ,good
 Most staff were lovely however when my elderly mother arrived by herself with heavy luggage to check in in the evening the one reception staff available refused to help her with her luggage he also gave her a hard time about helping her connect to wifi great location excellent breakfast charming atmosophere,good

No Negative The hotel was well situated next to a station great views from the top floor,good
 Lack of car parking for guests  Location was amazing Just feet away from all the main attractions of Camden Bed was comfy and shower facilities were spotless Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they even let us keep our luggage there once we checked out so we could spend our last remaining hours in Camden comfortably without carrying heavy luggage around Staff always greeted guests with a smile having a Starbucks downstairs really made the hotel wonderful I can t wait to visit again ,good
 Nothing The staff where exceptional polite could not be more helpful the room was very clean and spacious the bed was massive with toiletries tea and coffee facilities The staff squeezed us in for a late sitting in the evening although run out of some starters they quickly apologised and rearranged for us to have something else I can not fault this hotel the location was excellent literally 5 minutes walk from London kings cross and great access to the underground I would definitely stay again and recommend to all my friends and family Thank you ,good
No Negative The staff was outstanding Their weatherman Luigi was rarely correct with His forecast ,good
 Decor felt a little like a cross between a Google office building and a dorm room  Comfortable bed and great location ,good
 All round good hotel Only grumble would be that the shower area is not that private was not a problem for us but could be if you were travelling with a relative or something  The bed was very comfy and was a good location The 360 bar has amazing views and the drinks were not expensive as you would probably imagine them to be Rooms ultra modern clean and well maintained ,good
 An extra pillow would be nice  Bed is super comfy Rain shower is fabulous ,good
 There wasn t anything not to like  The room and dining room views over Hyde Park and access to the rest of London faultless Bed and Pillows excellent we had a superb nights sleep When I booked I emailed the hotel with some questions They answered the same day and true to their word they made our stay memorable by going the extra mile for us Breakfast was top notch fresh and flavoursome On arrival we were early and reception were unphased took our bags and ensured they were in our room when we got back very late 11pm Next day following check out they were very happy to look after our cases and coats for the day they were promptly returned when we collected them again much later in the day We feel it is walkable from Paddington 7 minutes tops We ll happily stay again when we go back to London ,good
 check in took a little long but that s being really picky did not have twin room left but upgraded to two single rooms which was good service The breakfast was excellent,good
 View from room understandable but building sites aren t the prettiest of views Excellent helpful and friendly staff As always the quirkiness of CitM ,good
 The shower s drainage was blocking easily It would be good to be able to open a window in the room to make the air flow across The Internet via WiFi is not so fast for a city as Barcelona doing basic actions not streaming was taking long time Difficult to go out to the yard in breakfast room with your hands busy door needs to turn the handle all the time Please put hooks to hang the raincoats inside the room next to the door Hangers inside the closet could be the normal ones no need to put those anti theft The friendliness and amiability of your staff is really great Breakfast content and taste,good
 The room service was a little bit inconsistent one day we didn t have room cleaning at all No electronic kettle in the room which was a big down  The room was spacey compared to most others in Paris and comfy very well located convenient and quiet supermarkets and restaurants around Highly recommended to all kinds of stay ,good
 Receptionists attitude Breakfast spread Room amenities,good
 Nothing Helpful staff,good

 Little bit cold in the room  Comfort and staff was eccelent ,good
No Negative very high standard,good
No Negative Alles Service faciliteiten locatie kamer alles is perfect ,good
 Room was rather small and bathroom small too Location was great Staff cordial friendly and quick to take action ,good
 Bed not overly comfy and a lot of noise at times from decorating and updating in adjacent rooms Hotel food very overpriced  The hotel is in a great position in the cathedral square with very friendly helpful staff Lovely d cor and very clean Good cafes and restaurants within very close walking distance and taxi rank just across the road A very comfortable and convenient location for seeing the sites ,good
 The bin in the room was filthy and needed a good clean The thin bin liner was sticking to the sides There was also a stain on the carpet and wall what looked like tea that had been spilled but not cleaned up Nothing major and easily remedied wouldn t stop me from coming back  Friendly helpful staff Small but well furnished very modern room Very quiet and had everything I needed Powerful shower in a light and bright bathroom Breakfast was great had salmon and eggs and they were more than happy to leave the toast off The continental breakfast looked comprehensive although I didn t have any of that Great coffee from a bean to cup machine Small detail but it makes the difference About a 2 minute walk from Euston Station and 5 minute walk to Regent s Place where my meeting was Would stay again ,good
 Bar restaurant menu didn t match food we were served Service was unbelievably slow maybe because there wax also a Michelin star restaurant on site Also room was very noisy on occasions due to nightlife in adjoining street  Excellent location helpful staff very clean,good
 The location was hard to get to by car and the room was a little cramped Great parking right outside the property and helpful staff,good
 Breakfast setup has changed significantly for the worse since our last stay  Great location being so close to Euston ,good
 After checking out I left my luggage at the concierge However when I returned I had to wait or over 20 minutes before I got my items as the concierge was elsewhere This resulted in me nearly missing my train  Good clean room which reflects what was promised on the photos Take note not all rooms have the old grand baths ,good
 Breakfast was too highly priced  Great service fantastic looking hotel amazing room looked fantastic and only a few mins walk to tube station ,good
 None  Great location only 2 min walk to stephenplatz and U bahn station Comfy bed and friendly hotel staff,good
 Nothing Breakfast a little expensive but to be expected in Central London and there were lots of other places locally  Great location great view from room comfy beds and very clean Handy taxi rank outside Bar in the downstairs lobby provided a welcoming buzzy vibe on a Saturday night V close to Edgware Road tube station and a good sized M S ,good
No Negative Great location out of the hustle of the centre but easy to walk and the beach is right there Great rooftop pool but not a lot of space ,good
 The decor seems a little outdated Felt like the hotel hasn t been modernized in about 10 years The lifts took forever to arrive during breakfast time on Sunday which resulted in people just hopping on any that weren t full just to get a move on Not much choice on takeout or eating out if you didn t fancy anything from the hotel  Every member of staff I encountered was courteous friendly Myself a couple of friends were happily assisted in taking some party decor to our rooms,good
 Nothing The concept of the hotel rooms,good
 Breakfast was pricey  The staff at the hotel are super friendly from reception to the bar The facility is modern and clean The location is perfect ,good
 Hotel quite difficult to find on foot  Location was good same standard of quality Love the iMac in the room THE GYM On the top floor it is well equipped extremely well air conditioned and has panoramic view of the city And is open 24 7,good
 Small rooms Good location close to the metro clean ,good
 Cobwebs on the window by the bath were the only minor issue Stand alone bath and balcony put a smile on my partners face room and service was great ,good
 They could have had a bit more variety at breakfast but the food was good and the staff was accommodating when we asked for extras at breakfast Nothing not to like really  I really loved this place and would stay there again on my next trip to Milan The location couldn t have been better Central and close to everything and yet the street was really quiet I also loved the modern decor inside a very old building The staff spoke excellent English and were very helpful and gave us good restaurant recommendations The room was spacious enough to fit the three of us comfortably and the linens and pillows were super comfy ,good
 I do not have something very importamt to tell but at my first stay they were doing scrambled egg for free when you buy continental breakfast They charge it now It would have been very good not to change it It would be also good to have chicken or turkey salami as an option alongside pork option  It is my second time there Rooms are perfect kovely and comfortable Location is great It is very close to Victoria and quite at the same time Great stay snd definitely will go again ,good
 Lighting of the room was so poor and i couldn t see a thing so i purchase a flashlight to see better at night they should improve this aspect Good location near metro,good
No Negative Hands down best concierge experience ever ,good

No Negative The TEAM the location the breakfast the room Everything was perfect Will the reception guy is amazing This is my hotel from now on in Barcelona ,good
 We had a hiccup with our room at the beginning of our stay however this was dealt with quickly and with the utmost professionalism We were concerned this lovely hotel was losing it s touch however after spending the weekend here all faith has been restored  This hotel has a wonderful ambience would highly recommend for a special occasion or just for a lazy weekend in London where everything is on your doorstep ,good
No Negative Our room was ready when we got there so that was great ,good
No Negative Everything The view the garden Roberto s restaurant a perfect stay ,good
 Room is small but then it s Paree  Location,good
No Negative Great hotel friendly staff good location,good
 If I m completely honest the bed was a little hard to our liking and we did struggle to get a good nights sleep even after walking round London all night The pillows and bedding was great just the mattress let it down I loved the location and how the hotel entrance was descreet I think the rooms are set out brilliantly and made the weekend very special what with the walk in shower speakers in the bathroom and general theme to the rooms Staff were fantastic and breakfast facility was very good,good
 nothing my second visit here amazing breakfast great staff comfortable bed lots of restaurants near by public transportation near the hotel,good
 Nothing it was all excellent Of all the hotels we ve stayed it this was the BEST The decor staff cleanliness service were better than most 5 without the high tariff,good
 Jacuzzi cold 1st room was invaded by appalling odour of cigarettes in the early hours of the first morning Staff changed our room with no problem Impossible to put bathroom light on without bathing the bedroom in light Sometimes wood is better than magic glass  Nice room and breakfast Staff very friendly Perfect location near to the underground and river ,good
 Smelled the mold in the room maybe because of the huminity Paris got too much rain this year  The hotel staff are very nice and helpful The location is great ,good
 I had to wait till 5pm for my room when check in is 3pm This should not happen in a 5 star hotel and is not acceptable when I spend over 500 for a 2 night stay No Positive,good
 Rooms are perfect for a solo traveller or couple but would maybe lack intimacy for friends travelling together My favourite hotel in London The rooms are small but so beautifully designed and functional that you don t want to leave Very good location also behind the Tate Modern,good
 I was disappointed with the Spa you could only use it if you paid for a treatment We only wanted to go in for half an hour to freshen up but were unable to do so  The hotel is excellent and in a great location All of the staff were very friendly and breakfast was very nice ,good
 My one complaint would be the bar in the lobby the bar staff not the waiters are quite rude and miserable There is also a 12 5 service charge even if you have one drink Discretionary but still not needed  The check in staff were very friendly upon arrival the hotel was very clean and the rooms spacious and very clean also ,good
 Shower didn t work Location Staff Room size and facilities Regular user of this hotel,good

No Negative Loved the pool and the steam rooms The rooms are great Huge bed our kingsize seems small,good
No Negative This elegant townhouse offers good quality accommodation in a good location A blend that maintains traditional features of the original building with modern amenities Being just opposite Hyde Park made for pleasant outlooks and strolls yet the bustle of Oxford Street is just 15 minutes walk away ,good
 Yes the property is currently being renovated and at check in it was explained that this would take a further two years to complete However it was not for the room I selected this hotel it was most certainly for the view  The view the location and the upgrade to a suite on the top floor ,good
No Negative Excellent support from staff kind and efficient Charming hotel with tasty fresh food for breakfast served in room Nell is a very comfortable place to enjoy one of the most known and characteristic arrondisment in Paris Montmartre ,good
 parking but reception did organize a spot next to the front door best hotel in town i travel a lot business but this real value for money ,good
No Negative Breakfast is fine the staff is prefassional Iamsterdam is not so big the location is very easy to city center by tram I want to appreciated the manager Miss Ivan she is very smart sincerely and professional to handle things also gave me soooo big surprise very touched and gratitude All the best to you ,good

 The piano bar was rather small Would need to get in early to get a seat The room and the general ambience of the hotel,good
 It said there was parking but we decided in end to travel by train This was good as there seemed to be extremely limited parking and would have been problem so felt wrongly described on bookings com The staff were very good,good
 Lift failureNo Positive,good
 The location of the hotel was much further than I would ve liked and also the value of money It was a good price considering how much the hotel normally is but I expected the room to bit more spacious  I liked how friendly and polite the staff were ,good
 putting a mini refrigerator in the room will give added points providing complimentary drinking water would improve the image does anyone don t brush their teeth everyday I think this is the least thing every guest would expect not to see in a hotel bathroom  the breakfast has a few good choices but complete in every range the hotel location is what i most appreciated about this hotel ,good
No Negative The staff were fantastic Excellent service,good
 The last night we had to take 2 separate rooms on different floors so we had to let one parent go with 1 kid each since there were not 2 rooms available next to each other  Personal attention was great Staff helped us book airport transfer and told us about flat fare via Paris Taxi to airport and back ,good
 Breakfast was adequate in terms of quantity but eggs were cold Sliced pan bread was bit of a let down  Single room was compact but comfortable There was little iPad in room with WiFi that was very helpful WiFi in hotel was also good Nice small reception area with free nepresso coffee Tea making facilities in room and fridge was bonus Staff were very helpful Room was clean and shower was good Central Area Baker street is best tube and there is good bus route ,good
No Negative Bed very comfy and staff very helpful,good
 Just the shower room can not close the water will put some in the wc Very nice hotel clean model new equipment and good service,good
 There was construction on the facsade during my stay so scaffolding and netting obstructed my view but otherwise there was nothing I didn t like about the hotel itself My room was petit pretty and typical Parisian with a touch of modern Minibar was fully stocked USB ports in the room for smart devices The bathroom was good size modern and good toiletries Hotel staff was friendly but most of all the location was perfect Literally steps away from shopping cafes Notre Dame and the metro ,good
No Negative Very clean well equipped and rooms set out well close to train station and tube ,good
 The rooms are too small considering the price one pays but the biggest problem for me was the lack of soundproofing in the hotel One can hear everything that happens in the upstairs rooms and next door I think that the partitioning between the various floors was poorly done no concrete used perhaps The location and the cleanliness of the hotel from the linen in the bedrooms to all the facilities including the public bathrooms and of course the fantastic and friendly personnel,good
No Negative Hotel was centrally located in a robust part of the city with access to public transportation It s the perfect area to explore shop dine and enjoy Amsterdam ,good

 We would have liked to be in our room sooner  We always enjoy the glass of prosecco and warm welcome when we arrive ,good
 A room had iner window and there were no fresh air smell from kichen appeared No Positive,good
 The rear of the property our room was located there faces the tracks of the District Line London Underground Occasional noise might be a problem for light sleepers despite sound proofing The bathrooms are clean and adequate but wouldn t suffer from a modernising renovation  Close to transportation walking distance to many attractions and shopping Large well appointed rooms Old school hotel with friendly receptionists ,good
 Cold plates at a hot buffet had to eat from cold food section No side plates  Bed was great Bathroom was good Room was fantastic thank you for the upgrade we are members We have stayed with radisson 5nights this year Like the nesspresso machine home from home Dressing gowns and slippers a good touch too ,good

 Slow wi fi during daytins windows do not open on higher floors security reasons  Great decor conpetent and friendly staff,good

No Negative Extremely friendly staff very clean and location was central to everything we needed,good
 Arriving back to Hotel at 12 15 am after a lovely night out with husband wanting a night cap before bed going to bar and being told they had no Smirnoff Vodka and no Bacardi For a Hotel which is undoubtedly 4 star this came as a shock whoever is in charge of beverage ordering needs a good shake up Pull your socks up Pullman  Bedrooms very large and comfortable,good

 shower pressure not good location,good
 First room shown was very small and pokey no parking on site congested road Super attentive staff quiet rooms choice of eating venues extensive menus nice toiletries good lighting,good
 The hotel is let down by the restaurant which is not typical of a HDV Staff seemed to be rushing around but not actually doing anything Several hot evening meals had to go back as they were cold this was rectified with alternatives quickly Service was also slow We all got the impression that the comments we were making were not unusual as they were greated with apathy Breakfast was also cold and had to be sent back  On the plus side the bedroom was immaculate and the team all friendly and very welcoming ,good
 Some times i was hearing noises from the street as the hotel is next to a bar The welcome The staff The room,good
 There was no price list for the fridge so we didn t have any drinks incase Also as we entered the 02 from the hotel we weren t allowed in the 02 restaurants which is what we wanted to do we should have been told that when booking in so we could have gone in the main enterance A few members of staff didn t speak very good English when we asked a question  Loved the room over looking the river very quiet and very comfortable,good
 The rest of the staff are 90 east europeans so the come with their own attitude so there wasn t much in the way of a traditional London welcome Breakfast tables are not wiped down properly so there is crumbs everywhere Bedroom wasn t cleaned properly on arrival and still had some past guest rubbish  Love the location and the building Great spot Reception staff are lovely and there was birthday cake in the room for my wife on arrival ,good
No Negative Everything was great ,good
 Nothing really it was a very good stay  We wanted a day room because my wife is disabled and we were coming to London for lunch and a concert The staff were very helpful having disabled parking available was a real plus It was just what we needed a space of our own to rest up in ,good
No Negative Excellent stay with children aged one and five The hotel was very child friendly which made such a difference to us ,good
 The only negative point is a rather large one I m afraid it s level of noise from the streets as there is no double glazing My partner and I aren t used to such a noisy environment and so we barely slept We asked to change rooms which was graciously done but I m afraid that the second room was only a slight improvement  It looks wonderfully modern with a great sense of design and culture the staff were both helpful and friendly and the location couldn t have been more perfect ,good
No Negative Very friendly and obliging staff Good location everything was good ,good
No Negative Super location and respectable sized rooms for London City center hotel Close to Underground and St Pancras train station ,good
 I couldn t fault our stay here I wish it was longer  The Hotel is a beautifully tucked away from the hustle and bustle of a busy London street But yet perfect location for Westfield shopping centre Kensington etc The staff were exceptionally friendly and the dinner was amazing Highly recommend the pork belly ,good
 Hot food during breakfast both days i stayed was pretty cold And an odd damp smell in the corridor outside my room  Good breakfast selection amazing location rainfall shower in our room balcony view of the Eiffel tower nice restaurant ,good
 The rooms could have been a little bit cleaner around the edges  The Club Room was fantastic and the staff on Check In were amazing Came back after attending a concert to find ginger tea with honey and lemon and a note saying its to soothe the sore throat from all that singing Fab customer service ,good
No Negative Location is excellent most things are within walking distance from the hotel Excellent customer service very helpful staff They assisted us with maps directions tickets for the Neucamp Also I mentioned in my booking that it was my partner s 30th birthday On arrival we were given a free room upgrade and a bottle of Cava in our room Highly recommend this hotel ,good

 Bedclothes to heavy hot though comfortable bed  Location good access to transport and central London Clean with plenty of space in the room Modern facilities ,good
 The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was clad in scaffolding However as our stay was over a weekend there was no work going on so it was no problem It was a shame to not be able to take a picture from the outside but we ll be sure to do that next time we come  Right from the moment we walked in the door the staff were amazing attentive polite and gave us the impression that nothing was too much trouble ,good
 The wifi was a little difficult always logging in Also had water issues on out carpet In room had no idea where it came from Smoking in hallways and other rooms And taking a shower completely socked the bathroom floor We loved the staff and location ,good

 The view from our room was onto the back of building works For a superior room our room was small The service at the bar was very very poor waited a lengthy time on 3 occasions Maids came to room in evening to leave fresh robes chocolates this was lovely Location excellent,good
 View and outdoor areas Size of the room ,good
 Nothing Everything was perfect Everything Place is awesome,good
 The place could use some spiffing up cosmetic not structural maintenance For example the court yard could use a major clean up hallways could use a paint job walls of our room had no decor  Great bathroom Excellent breakfast in a pleasant court yard Helpful front desk staff Spacious room with functioning air conditioner important in hot weather Attractive parlor with 24 7 coffee tea and snacks Excellent Italian restaurant Sole a few steps from the hotel Easy walking distance to many tourist attractions restaurants entertainment venues opera concerts etc Given central location in a capital city very good value for the money ,good
 Room service food wasn t as expected and varied disappointingly from menu ie chicken and bacon burger had no bacon Mozzarella and pesto panini had no pesto Might sound like I m being fussy but if you re dropping 10 15 on a sandwich you least expect it to be right Also the hotel was cheaper 100 a night due to refurbishments but this meant being woken at 9am on a Sunday by loud banging and drilling that felt like it was next to our head We rang reception and they did stem the loud noises for an hour but was still a bit rubbish for a Sunday morning even with the discount  Rooms look new and are modern with a lovely bathroom with rain shower and a comfy bed with huge tv ,good
 needs complete renewal Old furniture very few TV channels of poor quality picture noisy air con Didn t take breakfast there quite expensive and there are lots of cafes around location location location close to everything and in the heart of Mayfair historical village which is charming and full of restaurants Interenet speed was quite good And very friendly reception,good

 Not many options for a healthy breakfast including gluten or lactose free options for people either intolerant or allergic to gluten and or lactose  Great green juices in the restaurant of the hotel Concierge recommendations for restaurants near by the hotel were very good The location of the hotel is very good being close to all commercial areas either you want to buy fashion clothes or furniture ,good
 Room was smaller than I had expected Check in was quite busy long queue and only one staff member was checking people in  Friendly and helpful staff ,good
 I missed a human welcome My check in check out was self service which I don t mind but it would be nice if the staff at least greeted you when you entered  comfy bed close to public transport I didn t try the restaurant or the gym facilities but it s nice to know that they are there,good
 TV channels are very limited and no HD sports the SPA was closed for renovation but no one told me when booking or at check in  Very friendly and professional staff very comfortable and well sized rooms,good
 needs to have a working space in the rooms was not so good not ideal to work from  Good bed good service nice shower excellent turndown service,good
 Cost was 50 cheaper on second night No water in mini bar Breakfast abandoned as it was too busy 50 security charge despite only usually required in hotels with minibars etc but this hotel charges it regardless  Rooms were spacious and comfortable,good
 Nothing much just the usual gripe about the coffee instant that I don t like  It was priced and located appropriately for where we wanted to be ,good
 A whole crowd of Chinese who came back late and who thought the whole corridor belonged to them to shout and visit each other banging doors  Proximity to St Pancras for an early morning departure on Eurostar Enormous breakfast box ready for our early departure,good
No Negative Staff so friendly and helpful ,good
 Not enough staff on at breakfast blind shabby in room portable radiator in bedroom as a result a sore toe  Location,good
 We stayed for a whole week and never got fresh bed sheets The gym opening hours are ridiculous 8 to 8  Close to beach and town a few bars around too Hotel has everything you need the art needs some getting used to ,good

 We were given a handicaped room on arrival knowing well that we are fully abled people Was very disappointed Although we were moved to another room after our complaint The bathtub wasn t cleaned very often and there was no toilet brush to clean up when necessary We experienced difficulty with the light switch plus the Lightning on the floor is unnecessary anoying The fridge was hot all the time and stunk when opened Bedroom was stuffy and windows permanently locked  The friendly staffs from reception to cleaners Location was perfect Right in between the Barbican Station Moorgate ,good
 small room even though i had payed for a standard not basic room the room looked like the room from the booking com but standard not basic clean and good position,good

 A room safe would be a good idea slight pain having to use safety boxes in reception Doesn t stop us going back but something to consider  Always stay at the Grand when we are in London Staff are always pleasant and helpful Rooms Clean and well stocked The effort made for my wife s birthday stay a card a bottle of wine and some sweet treats a gesture well appreciated Well Done,good

 The WiFi could have been better ok for surfing but WhatsApp calls kept dropping  Located in a new part of town proximity to mall beach public transport incl hop on hop off tour busses could not have been better Even the Metro to and from the airport was easy The staff are incredibly polite helpful and well spoken in English I would definitely stay at this hotel again when in Barcelona ,good
 The room was very small but I can deal with it because the location and friendly staff My problem was the cleaning crew chatting and laughing loudly outside of my door every morning that just bothers me so much as I tried to sleep in on a Saturday morning after long week working in London It happened again Sunday morning I gave up I had no idea what they were saying because I didn t understand their language so I couldn t laugh with them  The staffs and location are big selling point for me It s right by Paddington station which is perfect for traveling anywhere taking the underground train or Heathrow Express to the airport just perfect ,good
 The price is ridiculous especially considering the breakfast with a very limited choice Even the car parking is expensive in my opinion  The position is quite ok the structure looks ok with a modern style Rooms are spacious and clean ,good

No Negative Location is ver good,good
No Negative We had two rooms one classic double and one junior suite We loved the classy soft furnishing of the room The marble bathroom was spacious and clean The air conditioning worked really well for the hot and humid weather in July The classic double is a bit small in size Nonetheless it has a big and really comfortable bed a well sized wardrobe armchairs coffee table etc Our three adult children had the junior suite It was roomy for three persons The bedroom was very spacious and one felt really comfortable to be in They had no problems to spread out their suitcases and shopping The bathroom was big with marble all round like the one in the double room but bigger in size The hotel is located in a quieter street There are many high end shops in the area The metro station is approx five minute walk from the hotel and there s a taxi stand nearby Taxi fare is quite reasonable in Milan It is a good option to have when you want to go to the other side of the town to join a tour Brera is a trendy and vibrant area nearby about ten minute walk away There are lots of restaurants to choose from the Pinacoteco di Brera an excellent art gallery not to be missed to visit and lovely little shops to browse into We arrived at the hotel from Milano Centrale railway station by taxi On departure the hotel reception has arranged a Mercedes van to drop us back to the station Both fares were reasonably charged compared to those of Rome where we last stayed ,good

 Had a meal on the Sunday evening and although the food was ok the service was a little hit and miss A few meals in the menu were no longer available  Hotel was excellent clean and comfy Breakfast were fantastic Rooms were well equipped plenty of free toiletries tea coffee and even a free beer ,good
 It was a problem for me having to walk down a long flight of stairs to the ground floor entrance I would have enjoyed an escalator alongside the one going up instead of having to walk through the caf to the lift for ground floor Alternatively add the ground floor next to the other lifts not really an option  Loved the comfy bed with warm light duvets shower was very clean with good water pressure unfortunately with no door it tended to get a lot of water on the floor Accolades for the efficiency of the unloading of luggage the welcome and charm of Michael and the same again on leaving ,good
 The informations from the reception about the hotel policies rooms upgrade free internet they were never the same Different people were giving different informations Also the firstt night we had a cold room so they brought us a heater and extra blankets and they ensure us that there was not a problem with the air condition The next day we changed room and there was not any problem  The location was very good close to the metro station only few stops from the central The waterfront rooms have an excellent view to the river The room is very large and the queen beds big enough for 2 persons each The madnesses and the pillows very comfortable ,good

 Maybe a bit more of a selection for breakfast for people on a strict Gluten free diet Although gluten free bread was available it would have been nice to have had gluten free sausages hash browns and black pudding All these are easily and readily available from most food retail outlets and could be frozen So if someone has an intolerance to Gluten they could let reception know to tell the chef to get out of the freezer the night before It was an expensive Bacon egg beans and tomato only for me  We liked this hotel during our one night stay It was convenient for the DLR with connections to the centre of London The staff were all friendly and very welcoming The bar stayed open late into the early hours of the morning after our evening out at a concert We were all very happy with our hotel choice and would consider coming back here should we ever be staying in London again ,good
 It was very noisy and crowded at the reception area I think an alternative sound proof loitering area should be created room service must be paid in cash there isn t any form of card payment for room service  I liked that the room was sound proof adequate room facilities ,good
 The room itself have a connecting door to the lobby toilet when I slept on the sofa bed I could hear the door sound in the morning it really distributing Also the space for the toilet it s too small for me since it was used the space for the public lobby toilet Last there is no place for soap and shampoo in the shower  The room is quite large but there s one problem in the room Overall the staff service is excellent Mention few names that helped my stay better to Osman Since the greeting until check out he s really there for the guest ,good
 Fire alarm went off at 3am in the morning not necessarily the hotels fault though  Most of the stay was amazing Lovely room Complimentary gifts Easy to get to Staff so friendly ,good
 They didn t have info about that we had breakfast included and we had to wait each morning for somebody to check it Bar prices were quite high but you can expect it in London  No problem with changing room as I was travelling with my mum abd sister so we wanted single beds in a room Staff were lovley and happy to help Breakfast was good pleanty of good quality food even that there was a wedding one night and our room was next to a ball room it wasn t as bad as I thought it could be didn t heard anything in a room Location maybe not central but communication was great bus stop next to hotel and about 15 min to tube station by bus ,good
 Tiny bathroom Clean quiet good location,good

 Why don t you try to put heaters under hot food like eggs bacon and sausages  Room was very good We can t say excellent as we had ants However we based our booking on the fact we had stayed earlier in the year and loved both room general atmosphere and mega breakfast ,good
 Could not fault this team and hotel  Location Wecome Security Comfortable and clean room Filtered water Space to relax,good
 Would have liked tea or coffee making facilities in the room The service makes this hotel The staff went the extra mile to help you It had a great location with the metro 100 metres away and the parking station next door The rooms were modern and clean ,good
 not a big fan of the location too far from city centre although public transport is close by we always prefer to walk  Very well appointed room clean and modern Staff were very nice and helpful,good
 Pillows very hard The room was very clean and comfortable Toilet and shower spotless ,good
No Negative Clean modern hotel good facilities good breakfast,good
 The toilet was pointing in the wrong direction so that your knees were pressed up again the shower door instead of facing into the bathroom where there would have been more room to sit down It s a shame there is no bar but you can still have a drink so it wasn t a problem  Loved the big comfy bed and the view of Nelson s Column The anniversary card chocolates and bottle of prosecco were a lovely touch,good

 I did not like that free WiFi access was only available in the lobby I have traveled across the USA and Europe and free WiFi connection throughout a hotel lobby and bedroom is no longer a luxury it s standard This is especially true for 4 star hotels This is the first hotel that did not offer free WiFi in the bedroom I also did not like that I was deceived from the hotel webpage that read free WiFi It did not specify that free connection was only in the lobby I also noticed that the air conditioning was not the same in all rooms My bedroom in particular had a very weak fan Others were much cooler  I thought the hotel was very clean and beautiful The lobby is outstanding and has a great aroma I considered asking what scent was used A few of the staff working the check in counter were very friendly and always had a smile Others were not as friendly I was assigned to the wrong bedroom but when I notified the staff I was upgraded to an ocean view free of charge That is excellent customer service ,good

 we were booked in a standard room wanted a larger room and were willing to pay as well they upgraded us to a junior suite as no other larger room was available for more than 100 GBP to our utter shock we realised that the so called junior suite was located outside the main building on ground floor the junior suite had connectivity issues and no network was available we complained about it as well the duty manager offered to change the room as soon as she could get one but we were not keen to stay in 3 different rooms for 3 nights the duty manager then agreed to waive off the upgrade charges when i asked her to consider our plight she gave a further discount on our stay  the staff at the breakfast venue were very hospitable,good

 The door to our room firstly we were traveling with a 20 month old little boy and he was able to open the door and leave the room at any time because of how low the handle was  Prior to the trip I was emailing the hotel regarding out stay I would just like to say they answered my emails extremely fast They were able to arrange a hotel transfer When we arrived at the hotel the staff were amazing and helpful I would suggest eating in the gothic quarter and not near the hotel as the food is better ,good

 The d cor in my room was dated the bathroom especially Could do with a new bathroom suite retiling  The bed was comfy and staff were very helpful ,good

 On some tube construction in the room were layers of dust the result of weeks not cleaning that particular spot The receptionist welcomed my feedback and ensured it would be inspected right away The rest of the room was clean though  It s right next door to Ziggo Dome which was very comfortable for us It s kinda cool atmosphere like although the prints on the carpet are rather boring It s OK with a rather mid standard image Nothing classy about the hotel The hotel comes with a nice bar with great local beers and with very friendly staff ,good

No Negative Stylish modern and innovative For a Budget hotel this is by far the best I ve stayed in the UK Design is quirky and fun throughout Views of the Tower of London incredible Our favourite aspect was how everything in the room is controlled by Ipad Loads of free films and fun entertainment all from the comfort of an enourmous bed Very clean with really friendly staff London is full of expensive average hotels and this has dramiatically raised the bar Might not suit a more traditional traveler who can t work an IPad ,good

 The room that was first allocated to me Why my points were not credited to me I did a booking using booking com but i paid myself in the hotel This is the first time this happens to me  Upgrade with a reasonable price,good
 Staff were abrupt at the restaurant when asked for food at 10 30 and said food had stopped being served but the website said until 11pm The restaurant didn t suggest getting food at the bar Had to pay a 50 deposit for the room per night hopefully this will be refunded soon The car park at garage 2 is strange there is no way down to the car park direct from the hotel you have to use the car entrance to access your car and walk across the car park  I liked that you got compilmentary ferry passes to cross the Thames I liked the Costa coffee in house down stairs ,good

 Nothing it was why I booked a Malmaison hotel over others It s special  When my wife and I booked in on the Friday afternoon my wife casually mentioned that we were down in London to see a show as it was her birthday that weekend You can imagine our supprise when we got back into our room late afternoon on the Saturday to find a slice of cake and a card from the hotel wishing my wife a happy birthday It was a lovely gesture and made my wife s day ,good
 Only one minor comment for improvement There is a small working table in the room without any electricity outlets near by This is a major issue for any business traveler such as myself Great location and great room One of the best buffet breakfasts I have experienced and I travel a lot,good
 no brush wifi,good
 Small for a family stay it says parking is available but not really Staff was helpful great location,good
 The one gentleman at the front desk initially who was a little dismissive His female colleagues were kind They kindly moved us to a room closer to the lobby which was very helpful for my husband We appreciated it,good
 Cost of food and choice limited for a vegetarian Staff were extremely helpful and efficient room was always spotlessly clean,good

 Lack of Gym Spa and a Swimming Pool  The location is excellent very clean spacious rooms very friendly staff and luxurious ,good
 Couldn t open windows to get fresh air for obvious safety reasons Despite air con I personally found it a little too warm  I was really worried about taking the car into London and where to park When we arrived at Copthorne Tara Hotel in the early evening it was a breeze Drove straight into their well lit basement car park and found several available spaces A stairwell is available from the car park to the reception We were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff Our club room was on the 10th floor Very clean and comfortable bed As we could access the Club Lounge we managed to avoid the long queue at breakfast and be in a more quiet setting Lovely breakfast with lots of choice and very attentive staff The location of this Hotel is within easy walking distance to museums and the Royal Albert Hall Would definitely book again ,good

 Beds were of poor quality Shower difficult to control It s not right in the centre if that s what you re after But the transport links are really good  Everything was in order Room was perhaps a bit outdated but everything was there What was really good was that we booked double bed but they had only twin beds left Instead they upgraded us to executive room with a beautiful view over the castle so we had a fantastic panorama on the fireworks that night ,good
 Washbasin separate from toilet and shower Room great,good
 Robes and slippers  Extremely spacious comfortable and clean suite More home than hotel ,good

 Modern clean and great design Great property in a great location which was ideal for the purposes of my stay ,good
 The room i booked which was a superior king room was awful I have stayed in better premier inn rooms for 3 quarters of the price It was just super plain and boring with nothing to it and the view was just a wall of a car park I managed to upgrade to a studio suite for an extra 100 pounds and this was very luxurious and more like what i imagined i was paying top dollar for  The hotel was great staff were friendly and on point The food was really nice and our room after we upgraded was excellent ,good

 Continental breakfast was included in the room price The hotel also had hot breakfast available for extra but the continental breakfast didn t have any eggs available which would have been an improvement My room was upgraded at check in to what they called a suite which had a sofa I suspect the original room would have been small No iron available or bottled water Hairdryer lacked power and was difficult to use with arthritic hands  Great location walking distance to underground stations Edgware Road and Paddington Huge variety of restaurants near by and in the Paddington Basin Right next to St Mary s Hospital so would be brilliant for someone visiting a sick relative or friend Small but well equipped bathroom ,good

 Plumbing problem encountered so no hot shower one morning but as it just opened I guess a few teething problems Also a mix up with bookings so delayed in checking in and a fire evac called during this time due to a toaster malfunction All teething problems  the location cleanliness as well as staff enthusiam Also the focus of Sandie when there was a booking mix up how she addressed it and made sure I was comfortable ,good
 As previous reviewers have said the rooms are very small but for London this is probably typical Upgrading to a Club room provides access to the Club Lounge which has seating areas computers and a coffee tea station Breakfast is a bit pricey as we were able to walk around the corner to a great little cafe and have a wonderful breakfast for half the price  We found this hotel literally at the last minute having arrived in London in the early evening to find that the original guest house that we had booked 7 months earlier had given away our room to someone else and the room we were being given would not have twin beds Upgrading to a Club room provided us with a lounge area on the 5th floor which was very nice as the rooms are small The beds were comfortable and the room was very clean The location is excellent the hotel is within a 5 minute walk to two tube stations numerous restaurants and grocery stores The staff was very friendly and helpful ,good

 Absolutely unacceptable to pay 25 euros per internet rate per day and a fee of 45 euros per person for a simple breakfast in an hotel where you pay an average of 400 euros per night With this rate internet should be included and breakfast too Hotel Arts at the time was the best choice now i d say it s very but very outdated  Impressive cleanliness They will clean your room twice a day and not only in the morning I love the location even though it s a bit far by the center if you want te be close the the seam this is the best spot ,good

 Room Small Area staff and location,good
 Staff in executive lounge were not positively helpful Asking for something seemed an effort on their part Tray left outside an adjacent room all day until we asked for it to be removed  Very handy for Wembley stadium Pool area was very good Room was very good Executive lounge was good quiet space Restaurant was very good Reception staff were helpful ,good
 Being told to return between 1330 and 1400hrs when our room would be ready and was a priority Returning at 1400hrs to be told that our room wasn t ready but was being cleaned as we spoke Asking at 1430hrs if rooms were ready to be informed that check in wasn t while 1500hrs We were aware of the 1500hrs check in time but having been told that they would be ready for 1400hrs it was a little disappointing  Fabulous Staff who couldn t do enough to help,good

 Dublex room is a little small Great staff location nice breakfast very clean and new,good
No Negative We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a bigger room bed it was so comfortable we wish we could have stayed longer,good
No Negative Location staff and comfort,good
 Booking com sending me alerts about my card being invalid and my reservation being cancelled is not very useful The hotel staff could not help me as this is an automated process and human understanding is ruled out This was very disappointing and I hesitate using booking com in future  The staff relocated me to a quieter room after one night ,good
No Negative Near station good view,good
 No minibar in the room room very small Good location very nice rooms,good

No Negative Excellent location near Eiffel Tower Metro subway RER railroad and upscale shopping the interior designer did an excellent job Great breakfast buffet ,good
No Negative I wasn t there long but everything was great especially the team ,good
No Negative helpful staff and location,good
 No idea I liked everything about this hotel  The location is great very decent area less than 1 mile from the Central Station and 2 subway stops or walking distance to the Cathedral The subway stop is right around the corner and the tram stop a few meters from the hotel Great shopping area also The room has plenty of space and everything you need it is clean and nicely furnished A mini bar and tea coffee facilities are also in the room Wi fi works fine Breakfast suits everyone as it has a lot of choices The stuff helps you at all times I will certainly book this hotel next time I come to Milan ,good
 Nothing The staff,good
 Nothing  Fantastic location Close to the Christmas market and only a ten min walk to dam square We were able to walk to the central station also The staff were so lovely and helpful They gave us advice on where to go how to pay for it etc They were so friendly can t thank them enough Can honestly say that I can t say a bad word about this hotel Just so clean and lovely Definitely recommend ,good
No Negative The room and the service,good
 Our room interior door handle fell off twice in 2 days We booked a city view room but could only see roofs of other buildings not attractive We were told this was the best they could offer as only the city view rooms have external windows The interior view rooms are dark and face the interior corridor Website photos deceiving re views and space on rooftop This is boutique small  Excellent central location and public rooms bars well furnished modern as expected of a new hotel Comfortable bed quiet room and spacious shower Rooftop bar area nice retreat altho tiny plunge pool only ,good
 The price a little too high  Nice room good breakfast Everything perfect ,good
 The smell of smoke in our room one night morning was overwhelmingNo Positive,good
 I loved every part of our stay  The whole stay was amazing friendly staff great hotel will definitely book again ,good
No Negative Very central location Very good breakfast with plenty of choice ,good
 The tea room over price tea scone 26 00 no cream tea was cold complained but nothing was done Staff not helpful in the hotel Location for the palace was excellent Bed very comfy ,good
 All good Comfortable bed it was firm which is great for me,good
 The mattress on the bedNo Positive,good
 The bed had a wooden base which was very hard  Brilliant location and friendly staff ,good
 The shower was cramped and water sprayed on the floor of the bathroom But we know that this sort of thing is typical in many European hotels and it really didn t bother us at all  This hotel has the best service and most friendly staff we ve ever had anywhere and we ve traveled around the world so this is really saying something Staying here is more like being in a bed and breakfast or someone s home than a hotel because everyone treats you like you are a special and cherished guest Everyone also speaks excellent English and they genuinely want to ensure that your visit to Paris is perfect Everyday there is a 3 hour afternoon tea with free sweets savory snacks and non alcoholic beverages you can also purchase alcoholic drinks from the bar Breakfast is amazing with hot eggs bacon beans and sausages not to mention fresh fruit breads and pastries yogurt and much more Our room was large and comfortable and the beds were good The windows in both the room and the bathroom could be opened wide something I always appreciate The mini bar is stocked with a range of water soft drinks and fruit juice and it is free for the guests They do charge for refills but we didn t drink it all up in our four days here The fridge is large enough to hold a bottle of wine or two and the hotel will gladly provide a bucket of ice if you need to chill a bottle quickly The wifi is very good though you do have to sign in again each time you use it The hotel also offers a portable wifi device about the size of a deck of cards that you can carry with you as you explore Paris This allows you to access the internet and googlemaps from anywhere as well as send photos to your friends at home to make them jealous The charge for this device is only one euro a day which is a fantastic deal It worked very well for us and we think it is a simply brilliant idea for a hotel to offer this to guests who may not have a local mobile phone The hotel is just a few blocks from the Arc de Triomphe in a quiet non touristy neighborhood There is a small grocery store in the same block and many restaurants and cafes nearby ,good
 Hotel is old tho Breakfast was nt great Did nt have many options for the price we had to pay  Rooms are spacious Location fantastic Next to metro station,good
 Service from waiters in their evening lounge was slow not enough people on duty the concierge service is possibly the best in the world,good
 Overflowing shower shower design Location,good
 Lighting was very dull In the rooms Only caused concern when applying makeup for a gala event Comfortable rooms Friendly staff,good
 Nothing  Everything was perfect It s just a short distance from a number of metro lines so the location is ideal with easy access to Saint Germain des Pres Trocadero Montmartre and other areas The staff were very friendly particularly the breakfast restaurant staff The room was great and the bed was incredibly comfortable The breakfast was excellent and wide ranging with outstanding pastries They even had little touches like mini chocolate eggs under the tea cups for Easter All in all it was a brilliant stay ,good
 Unfortunately it was very noisy from 7AM as the cleaning personal was talking in front of our room and then they started renovation a room next to our Sleeping after 9AM was impossible Breakfast was good and it has a big variety,good
 If you re in a room which has a view of the main road The cars going by can be a little noisy if you re sensitive to noise Opt for the backward facing if this is an issue for you  This is my 3 rd stay here The staff are super super friendly and very helpful If you re lucky there is parking right in front of the hotel Hotel has always been spotless I went for the executive double which was very spacious and cozy The shower is the best part of the room Value for money is great Amenities in the room are excellent ,good
No Negative Location Room on 2nd floor,good

No Negative I did not have my breakfast at the hotel But overall quality of other services were good The people at the reception desk was quite friedly ,good
 Very poor wifi signal and soundproof isn t that great as you are informed whenever a metro is getting close  Location is good and staff are friendly and helpful ,good
No Negative Clean rooms friendly staff and close to several public transport options The hotel is also in walking distance of many of the city s best known attractions such as the Gaudi Cathedral Gothic quarter beach port food market amongst others 3 days wasn t enough time to discover this beautiful city and its culture ,good
 Ridiculous prices for in house services breakfast 25 for basically coffee plus simple bites if you want a fried egg it s 10 extra I travel a lot internationally I have never seen this kind of price level in this segment anywhere Bar 7 50 for a beer of course the place was deserted It feels like you are being forced out to look elsewhere for anything else than sleeping  Clean and modern,good
 The style of the room is very old but that s kind of the old Viennese atmosphere as well  The staff was very nice giving good tips for the surrounding we forgot our adaptator so they borrowed us one very kindly The breakfast is great the rooms are very clean the location is perfect ,good
 Although complimentary tea and coffee making facilities in room you only had 2 tea bags unless you like fruit teas and no complimentary water For a hotel of this standard was quite surprised Mini bar very expensive  Location and access to the O2 fantastic Room restaurant and bar views great Good tube connection only 5 10 mins walk Breakfast was excellent Great buffet choice ,good

 Bathroom very compact And could hear next door room talking and music Helpful staff and good location,good
 Nothing Every thing in the hotel is great,good
 Like all London hotels it was far too hot especially in a room where you cannot open the window Air con noisy and drying but at least traffic noise is shut out  Wonderful location delightful staff and we were upgraded which was an unexpected treat Thank you Rubens team Breakfast is the best we have come across in London sorry we missed it this visit but couldn t resist a lie in ,good
No Negative Location good for the event we attended,good

 Just more tea in the room  Staff were excellent in ensuring we had what we needed For an overnight stay when visiting the sights this place is perfect It isn t the place to go if you are after luxury but we have stayed here twice and it was brilliant I made a mistake with one booking and even entered the wrong ate but the manager kindly sorted it out and ensured I had a room Superb and discrete service ,good
 It was to hot to sleep No Positive,good
 Could be few more people to maintain breakfast room during rush hours was difficult to find free clean table  Perfect localization just at the subway 10 minutes to city centre Nice clean rooms good service ,good
No Negative A lovely quirky hotel the reception staff where very knowledgeable A most courteous welcome Perfect location for La Rambla close enough to walk explore and shop but quiet enough to miss the all noise as the hotel is situated in a side street with traffic restrictions We would highly recommend this hotel for a city visit to Barcelona ,good
 No refrigerator in room even though it s rated 4 stars Maybe that s the new thing thought it was odd though  The bed was soooooo comfortable I was asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow And lovely and close to hyde park to go for a walk each morning Loved it would stay again ,good
 The rooms were a little cramped and the bathroom there was very little surface space for toiletries etc Badly positioned mirrors and a vanity mirror only good for hitting yourself in the face with  The staff were very helpful and welcoming Hotel was well presented and clean The beds were very comfortable ,good

 When we returned from the theater we would have enjoyed a drink in the bar Unfortunately there was a private function on and we could not go down A waiter finally came up for our order but I thought a guest in the hotel would be able to visit the bar of an evening Otherwise a pleasant stayNo Positive,good
No Negative Your hotel is my favorite choice in Barcelona lovely helpful staff beautiful hotel in a great location unfortunately the food is too expensive to eat there Some cheaper options would be good thanks for a great stay I would ask for special consideration next time as our plane was so delayed that we arrived at 2 30am and missed the day that we paid for ,good
 Hotel falsely advertised the price of a taxi to the hotel from central Amsterdam they said it would cost 40 when it actually cost 12 if you didn t book a taxi through the hotel Hotel made it look quite complicated to get into central dam using public transport It is a lot easier than as is made out Trams and buses went from right around the corner of the hotel into central Amsterdam Good price for location and accessability,good
 The distance from central London but I guess any closer to London would have been more expensive The concierge was very friendly and understood the purpose of our trip The room was clean and comfortable The service was perfect in every wat,good
 The AC does not work and the rooms are way too warm Location and staff,good
 Could do with a few more tea bags in the bedroom following a long day out in London that cup of tea just makes it  Great Location 10 mins to Earls Court Station 5 mins from Sainsburys if you want the odd thing during your stay ,good

 Can t think of a thing  Everything was superb The staff went out of their way to be helpful When there was a slight glitch in the check in process that was due to a new computer system the manager expressed the hotel s apologies by sending a bottle of champagne and arranging a complimentary breakfast The location was exceptional in beautiful quiet location Chelsea and directly across the street from an Underground station ,good
 Hairdryer is crap the breakfast could have been better and the staff was to quik to take my breakfast of the table when I went to get more to drink  Nice hotel for the money I payed large room the AC is very good ,good

 Small rooms  KFC next door ,good
 Room is very small I know London accommodation is always on the small side but it was pretty crammed I would have thought a bar fridge would have been nice but as I looked around I really could not see where they could have fitted one However bathroom was a good size unlike other places where you almost have no room to dress within the bathroom Mattress sagged transversely across the mid segment of the bed because the base of the bed was two segments brought together I don t mean two single beds brought together which would have been ok but 2 bases brought together one from the head and one from the foot to meet in the middle It was very odd and I think someone with a bad back would have been in trouble because of the sag in the mattress where the two segments met  Location Impossible to beat 5 minutes walk from Russell Square Station and 7 minutes from Holborn Station 10 minute brisk walk to Oxford St 15 min to Leicester Square if you like walking which we do literally right next to the wonderful British Museum 2 Sainsburys within 7 min walk for items you need Good reasonably priced meals on Southhampton Row 1 street down and adjacent streets Very clean I m very fussy about this and they passed with flying colours Attentive to requests Nice warm room no stinting on heating and when it got too warm you could switch off central heating which would bring the room down to an ambient temperature of about 21degrees C Also a pet peeve of mine inadequate wall sockets which they passed with flying colours ample wall sockets at desk and below both bedside tables for charging all of your mobile devices and laptop,good
 The location of costa coffee outside the entrance makes the going in out little bit noisy and uncomfortable specially for families Staff were helpful The complementary fridge and the daily change of the components Location is super perfect concierge service is excellent and know will variety of the breakfast my room was corner suite apartment enough for 2 Adults with 3 kids between 5 years 9 years old ,good

 The elevator from the pavement to the reception was not working there was no sign in English out of order or something else and i was stuck inside Another thing such a hotel should had a thermometer some basics from a pharmacy kit  The location of the hotel is ideal Not in the center which is noisy and a little dirty but in the next neighbourhood where you are close to everything The hotel is brandnew and the beds the matrasses and the pillows are lovingly supersoft you just do not want to get up Also the girls in the reception are very kind smiling and always helpful ,good

 The wi fi was unusable The free computer was unusable that s a major problem for travellers I purchased a SIM card to enable connectivity we were not alone in this experience You must fix this or we cannot return The sign coffee costs an additional 2 40 per cup was misleading coffee is included in the breakfast My concenious wife paid for three coffees after breakfast because she did not properly inderstand the sign Otherwise the hotel was very satisfactory  Access to purchase transport and shops,good

No Negative Eugenia was a fantastic help with assisting us to reschedule a long distance train trip She deserves a raise,good
 Caution the room sizes differ in the same category Standard Double room with balcony is bigger than a standard double room with windows The hotel staff however did not agree The floor looked extremly crammed Also the carpet did smell of dust The hotel recpeption was a little confused about everything which maybe due to lack of manpower  Well I liked the location a lot It was extremely close to a metro station and amazingly clean area The interiors of the room is beautiful and clean and we had a very comfortable sleep The breakfast has a lot of variety too ,good

 The hotel is about a 10 to 15 minute walk from Clapham Junction the nearest point on Lonfon transport unless you count buses I defy any first time visitor to find their way without some trial and error through a housing estate and a park We didn t eat in the hotel so I can t comment on that The staff were all exceptionally friendly and helpful I know it s their job but it struck us how charming the staff on the front desk were,good
 The breakfast was beautifully presented but I would have liked a cooked breakfast eg scrambled eggs  Very comfortable rooms with free internet and a free mobile cell phone which guests can use around the city I was very comfortable there and it was so convenient to Kings Cross St Pancras stations which have lifts and escalator access All staff were very helpful ,good
No Negative The staff were so polite and helpful the room was really big and the dinner at the restaurant was amazing,good

 Extra charge for wifi Free cookie ,good
 Our room did not suit our needs well It would have been excellent for a businessman with little luggage or grooming needs I learned that my recent strategy of booking a room with more square feet did not necessarily get us a more comfortable room in ways that were important to us  The location is excellent Two tube stations and many shops and restaurants are very convenient and beautiful Hyde Park is right across the street We love this part of London The facilities are clean and of good quality The bed was comfortable I now understand that there are a variety of accommodations available here ,good

 There were no blackouts for the windows and being a light sleeper I was awake very early with the sun shining through although at least the sun was shining Then room was very warm top floor but there was a fan in the wardrobe if needed  The location was perfect for the O2 with a short hop on the Thames clipper to get there Lots of things to do nearby breakfast of croissants etc next morning was lovely and plentiful Staff were fantastic and happy to help anyway they could ,good
 there is construction site and they started working at 7am in the morning so i couldnt sleepNo Positive,good
 The beds were uncomfortable and the decor in the hotel rooms was dated and in need of updating It would have been better if the fridge in the room stocked bottled water for using in the kettle as I had to use tap water from the bathroom or buy bottled water to make tea or coffee  The location was excellent The rooms were very clean and quiet and were cleaned every day ,good
No Negative location is good,good

 Our bathroom door was poorly constructed which lead to a room flood we moved rooms and the same happened The pools were lovely but not as clean as I would ve hoped There was a bloody plaster in the 3rd floor pool over a 2 day period which prevented me from enjoying this  The staff were very homely had plenty of time for their visitors the room was comfortable clean and the breakfast buffet had plenty to offer It is coveniently locaded next to the shopping center a short walk to the beach Metro was also close by and easy to use ,good
 Poor wi fi not working fridge  Good Hotel ,good

 The first room they gave me when I arrived looked into a service chute that they called a courtyard there was barely enough room to walk around the bed and it was claustrophobic The standard room I had before I upgraded was small falling apart in many places and not very clean  The privilege room was excellent I only recommend booking this room type ,good

 The mattress was very uncomfortable and hard Lobby reception bar extremely small and cramped We asked to leave our bags in storage with the hotel on the day we checked out We came back in the evening to find our bags along with others unattended in the corridor leading to the toilets next to the lobby Very unhappy with that Some staff members very pleasant others not so much  The location is perfect The exterior of the hotel is beautiful Bathrooms are very modern ,good

No Negative It was ok to live there and staff were very helpful ,good
 The classic bathroom with freestanding bath was beautiful and luxurious However in a hurry showering with a hand held albeit brass shower head wasn t the most practical But I m really splitting hairs here  It s a beautiful classic London hotel in an amazing part of town and the staff and service were exactly what you d want in such a place It felt like the kind of establishment that could be a front for an old English secret service Loved it ,good

 Trouble reaching room service TV not functioning due to a plug not being all the way in and that s where room service menu is located Maintenance was quick and very cheery to fix our broken tv the very best employee interaction of our entire visit Then room service wouldn t pick up the phone Had to ring through front desk to get them Our room had wood panels replacing marble in the bathroom The bath was in need of an overhaul and the maids kept it very clean but it was noticeably shabby The concierge who serviced our bags while we were out was rude and abrupt both times we engaged with him Not a good fit for a concierge position He was on a personal call when we first approached When we returned he couldn t find our bags and we had to go hunt for them I m usually very charitable on employee reviews but we had mediocre restaurant service with a very long wait for the food and downright rude concierge assistance  The meal we had was very nice for hotel food Prices were a bit high but it was well prepared The beds were very comfortable great pillows Love the shampoo etc Location near the mall provided a wide variety of restaurants and there were even more down the road in the opposite direction Very close to the tube station The a c worked extremely well and the room was quite comfortable ,good

 I was slightly disappointed that having booked a superior room with a city view we were on the side of the hotel that faced towards the airport as opposed to Amsterdam itself But still we had a view and it didn t take away from our time there That combined with the fact breakfast is not included meant we found the rates for a 2 night stay here very high  Superb location really nice walk into the center Good facilities spa sauna gym which we made use of one morning Nice little bar in the lobby staff were very friendly and attentive there in particular Tea coffee making facilities in the room Very comfy bed Decent shower ,good

 Our room was rather boring and plain but it was in the annexe My sister and brother in law had arranged champagne and nibbles to be given to my husband as a birthday surprise when we checked in but no one knew anything It took me having to ask two reception staff to check and insisting that the champagne should be here before we were finally shown to a prepared table in the Booking Hall It seemed that food and beverage staff hadn t liaised with reception staff so we weren t on their screen Just as well my sister had told me or it would have been spoiled No joined up communication then in this age of computers  The beautiful old part of the hotel that we sadly didn t stay in Wonderful decor and opulent staircase Our room was very quiet even though it was on a main road ,good
 The elevators are not enough in the morning This is a business hotel and mostly hotel guests use them in the morning hours and so there is a big waiting  The view of the Eiffel tower is amazing The location is perfect there is a subway which is connected to the hotel by the shopping center and it was a very convenient option The room was clean and tidy the receptionist Mrs Meher so kind and very professional The hotel is very well run It can be said that the hotel it is about 3 stars but the staff makes it a four star The largest and most important part is the staff They deserve to be rewarded Tips The bar on 34 floor is incredible ,good

 Our only complaint is the beds Apparently they don t have double donnas at all and I think all their double beds are 2 singles pushed together which is annoying but do able I guess  Staff were helpful easy bus ride to the city centre and a super market in walking distance All in all it was very nice,good
 Furnishings could have been more comfortable and it was extremely difficult to use the TV  Room was large with older style furniture Linen was clean beds were very comfortable Coffee making facilities were good bathroom excellent shower over the bath may not suit everyone but water pressure was amazing Staff were helpful choice at breakfast was wide and food was fresh and delicious ,good
 Well Hotel is in industrial zone so there is nothing to be seen Which do not make it negative because hotel is excellent from inside  Hotel is excellent rated 4 stars and definitely worth it Comfy bed good service quality experience Next to Park Royal metro station 25 minutes from Central London Staff is positive helpful They offered us our luggage to stay later than our check out which helped us to walk around the city without any problem in our last day of the visit ,good

 I would have liked a more expansive menu but know that this is a relatively new young hotel Can appreciate that they want to focus on quality definitely doing that rather than quantity at this time  That there was no request too big or too small for the staff to tackle and with a smile From helping to arrange airport transportation to securing tickets to providing directions to service in the restaurant and caf this international team excelled in all areas Thank you Team La Villa Haussmann ,good

 very very noisy double glassing Windows would fix the issues No Positive,good
 Bigger rooms Tasty breakfast selection,good
 The hotel runs on heating and air conditioning but not at the same time It is all either one or the other which the Hotel decides at its discretion So when I arrived my room was incredibly hot and the only solution was to open the window Street noise below Whilst the bar lounge have a very pleasant atmoshphere I had to join a queue of guests to be served as there was only one barman amd no waiting staff on duty At the prices being charged this was no where near satisfactory There is much to like at this hotel The staff are helpful the rooms well presented the food is of good quality the bar and lounge areas are very comfortable albiet some of the furniture is ageing It is also in close proximity to the underground and walking distance to many of the most famous UK tourist attractions,good

 We were told we got upgraded on arrival to the Eiffel tower view room wow great In we go into the smallest elevator ever 2people max to the top floor The room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the Eiffel tower for what that was worth What they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing I mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor Crazy We informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the Eiffel tower from the balcony So much for upgrades Nice hotel in a great location Next to Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon and 5 mins walk to center of Saint Michel The hotel also has lovely little balconies overlooking the rooftops so i recommend you get a room on the top floors ,good

 temperature in the room too high and hot water issues  Design breakfast staff,good
 the only issue I had was the location which they obviously can t change with all the government buildings around the area feels isolated at night there were two of us and we never felt unsafe on the street but I would be uncomfortable staying there alone I think and having to walk by myself back to the hotel after dinner  loved the side courtyard liked our room great bathroom and mostly were very impressed with the staff who were uniformly warm and helpful ,good

 This is being really picky but our room had a bath and in this day and age you expect bath taps to be in the middle edge of the bath so you can share a bath but unfortunately the taps were at one end so we couldn t share the bath Also despite being able to to call down and get more sent to your room having more tea coffee and milk in the room initially would have benefitted us But these are very picky points as it was truly stunning  We went for our 1st anniversary and they upgraded our room one of the staff hand made us a card and sent up a special cake for us The staff were all very polite and helpful really excellent The rooms and facilities blew our minds we didn t think you could get things like that without paying huge amounts of money The view is extraordinary the best in London we did a lot of sitting at our full length and width windows and enjoyed the view A truly excellent all round experience I would recommend this to anyone even if you can t afford it save up for it just once it s truly worth it ,good

 no reason to complain brilliant location,good
 Booking a room that was not the room photographed in picture and being told that there is only one of that room in the hotel and that it was taken Our room was definately small and not worth almost 500 dollars per night Pool and top deck was awkward and small and was divided by plants to other top floor executive suites No privacy for them or myself The hotel rooms are small and the bed so close to the cupboard that you can hardly open the doors without hitting the bed  Location was great Right in the middle of everything Staff where wonderful after the initial shock of the room not being the same as I booked ,good

 Very small room Bathroom had all that you need but was tiny  Comfy bed,good
No Negative Perfect location great staff beautiful hotel and very clean accommodating bedrooms with a very comfy bed I would really recommend ,good
 Flooring and wooden bed frame that creaked and the dim energy saving lights in the bathroom which are so common in hotels these days Hey everyone they do make brighter energy saving light globes A simple cooked breakfast option included in the tariff and not extra would have been appreciated  The location just around the corner from Earl s Court Station was great Bought an Oyster card and caught the train everywhere even to Heathrow We were happy with the size of our room and the bathroom good to have a window that opened to let a cool breeze and fresh air inside Considering its closeness to a busy road the room was quiet even with the window opened We enjoyed sitting in the outdoor garden whilst killing a bit of time before leaving Comfortable pillows and good continental breakfast ,good

 Breakfast was very nice but a bit pricey at 15 euros  The hotel is centrally located but on a quiet street with pleasant cafes steps away The staff was knowledgable pleasant cheerful and accommodating The property was pristinely kept The cushioned bay window seat in the room and the elevator were both enjoyed appreciated by my mother The linens were crisp fresh and sumptuous The train station to the airport is a short walk away Excellent choice for travelers on the go ,good
No Negative We had a small problem reported it to reception It was instantly taken care of and we were made to feel special We would definitely stay here again Great location near the designer shops wife loved that loads of places to eat and have a beer I loved that ,good
 As for London the room was small and compact The room and hotel were bright modern and new on a quiet side street away from mainstream Also close to train station and services The breakfast would satisfy most needs The use of a mobile device for free phone calls and local travel needs was an added bonus ,good
 Minor issue The restaurant is a popular place for power breakfast so it is extremely busy with locals lots of interviews and business meetings happening around you not the best way to start the day from a hotel guests perspective Minor issue 2 boy that B O TV they have in the rooms is over the top and ridiculous So much money wasted on a TV that can t do the most basic things easily e g change channels What a technological disaster I gave up and didn t watch TV for the 5 days I stayed there  Service Staff is very professional well groomed and attentive The front desk manager promptly clarified questions I had about my bill in email explaining to me the breakdown of charges I came out ahead Kudos to her Location Right near the tube and a 2 minute walk away from tons of restaurants I don t know all the areas of London well but sure seemed like a convenient location Restaurant Food was excellent Just one or two minor service hiccups forgot to bring my coffee and awkwardness dealing with payment but for the most part the quality was outstanding ,good
 Free wifi  The bar staff were excellent being very professional while being very friendly The knowledge base on Vodka with my particular barman was amazing He made a great martini too ,good
 Painfully slow check in Just wanted to get to our room but we and the people ahead of us in the slow queue had to endure lengthy explanations Why not email guests beforehand about Hilton membership and give them a chance to fill out forms Other hotels booked through the same website have contacted us in this way before our visit  Big comfortable room Excellent breakfast with lots to choose from ,good

 A bit far from the center of the city but not bad location  Breakfast was great and the room was comfotable ,good
 Having the toilet and shower incorporated in the room is something we needed some time to get used to It also took us some time to get to terms with the technological controls of the room I imagine it would be quite a challenge for some people especially older I guess the whole thing is designed for younger people The room was rather small with little wardrobe space The breakfast was so expensive we didn t even try it  It was very well connected and the staff were friendly and helpful The design of the hotel makes it attractive The use of technology makes it quite practical ,good
No Negative Location on Las Ramblas next to Metro Wonderful service room amenities in a beautiful building The balcony with our room had outside lounge chairs plus chairs with table Wonderful shower and products Roof top bar and restaurant although we didn t really get to use it because of a private party going on ,good

 The breakfast lacked healthy options No porridge and no greens berries No omelette either When I asked for greens I got a plate full of rucola with pesto Strange No natural yoghurt just hard and stiff quark One morning I asked for natural yoghurt and eventually got it the other day the same member of the staff told me that quark was yoghurt That was strange and funny They should do something about airconditioning it turned on automatically every morning even though I had turned it off and I got sick as always do with aircon The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and we were forced to go out Reason a couple had prepared food and burned something Maybe the stoves should be automatically turned off at 10 PM Too small trash can Recycling for paper and bottles but why not for bio waste Small adjustments nearly perfect hotel  Neat and clean new hotel Super nice personnel Quiet room nice little kitchen and functional stylish bathroom Liked the furniture and modern air of the hotel Not too far from the city although 10 minute walk to the tram stop 20 minute tramride seemed a bit long ,good

 furniture a bit old Pillow wasn t comfortable Nothing else  The staff were good and very helpful The hotel is near by shops restaurants Only half an hour walking to the Duomo ,good
No Negative Knowledgeable staff,good

 The lighting in the room was very dim and not conducive for work purposes and wifi was only limited to 2 devices  The location was excellent a stone s throw from Russell Square Station The room was very clean and the facilities were great too though we didn t manage to make use of the gym or visit the onsite restaurant or bar ,good
 The breakfast wasn t great the was the downside it could have been a lot hotter It The staff very pleasant ,good
No Negative Satisfying breakfast helpful staff,good
 Poor wifi Sometimes we didn t have connection to internet It was really Low speed And there was no air conditioner in the room Rooms facing the street were noisy at nights We ask the reception to change our room with an apposite sites room and they kindly changed our room It was a good hotel with nice and helpful staff and spacious room Breakfast was good Good access to public transportation And only some minutes walking to Duna river,good

 The air conditioning in our room was exceedingly noisy so much that we decided to switch it off and sleep with an open window Not a huge discomfort but not adequate for a hotel of this level had we stayed longer or in a hotter period I would definitely have complained to the staff  We were in London for a city break and the hotel s position was perfect 200 metres from Tower Hill 50 from the underground station Room furniture cleanliness and services are what you should expect from a five star structure The swimming pool is a big plus if you are staying for more days Price adequate to the level and position of the hotel ,good
No Negative Location,good

 Breakfast was abit chaotic First morning it took about 5 requests for coffee but this improved  Bed very comfortable Room nice Electronics lighting etc a bit baffling but we got there in the end Lifts good spa and gym good ,good
 The windows were single glazed so let in the noise and the cold  The staff were very helpful with restaurant recommendations and always had a big smile to cheer me up ,good
 Rates were high for the type of room offered but this is likely due to MWC conference and the scarcity of hotel rooms  Friendly staff Location near a main subway train line also great ,good
 Room is a bit small but alright as sits in very good location elevator is quite small could only fit in two people and 2 hand luggages but it doesn t matter At all  Great value for Central Paris Just few steps away from the Wagram metro station and a very good supermarket just next door 15 20mins walking distance from the Charles de Gaulle Etoile Bed is comfy and bathroom is quite nice Air con works quite well therefore really comfy Overall it s a nice hotel in Paris Would recommend it ,good
No Negative Staff very helpful stored luggage whilst we were on a three day tour Closer to louvre and metro,good
 The view and no porters to help with luggage  Our view was the back yards of a row of house on the back side of the hotel We got the furthest room from the elevators and no help was available to take our luggage Close to a variety of restaurants a block away Easy walk to them just past the major Royal Mail building ,good

 Reservation was confirmed by booking com so we assumed all was good When we arrived booking had been cancelled because they had been unable to take test payment from our card registered with booking com which worked perfectly on the night of our arrival HOWEVER they had not informed us directly or via Booking com As it happened they still had a room and honoured the booked price so all was GOOD but would advise directly confirming your booking especially at busier times of year  Central near to tube ,good

 The breakfast was a major let down compared to other Hilton hotels I ve stayed in over the years Toaster machine needs to be replaced due to 4 attempts to get any sort of colour on my toast Stock levels on various items were never topped up Apple juice was non existent had to ask 4 members of staff for butter by which time my toast was stone cold Staff don t understand the concept of stock rotation as when topping the stock of sausages bacon scrambled eggs etc all the new stock was dumped on top of the stock that had been sitting there for a while If anybody left it till late for there breakfast they could be eating food that had sat there for hours Not the Hilton standards I m used to  The whole experience was spot on with our stay ,good
 I believe they are renovating the whole hotel the common stairs need a bit of the magic they ve dome with the rooms  Fantastic location in the heart of Chelsea but on the quietest street A small group of houses converted to a non stuffy 5 star hotel I was given a very large completely renovated room and think I scored a great price here Espresso maker in the room beautiful bath Spotless Thick towels turn down service quiet Great decor It was warm in London and the air conditioning was awesome cool quiet and didn t freeze you out Short walk to the tube Never used the common rooms or restaurant bar etc but they all looked cozy and high tea looked delicious from what I could tell Very friendly staff Will stay here again ,good

 At check in I felt the person checking me in was checking that I was who I said I was It was uncomfortable All other staff were great His manner was a bit odd for the front desk He wasn t unhelpful just a bit off First given a room on the 6th floor which was musty It was changed but not without the same man trying a hard sell on charging me half price for an upgrade on that floor I didn t like that after 7 hours travelling and just wanting to eat and sleep He told me there was just pizza and ham and cheese toastie available but when I went to order from the room there was also chicken tikka My experience would have been better if I had never encountered him  Quiet room Comfortable and clean Nice breakfast Short walk to Excel Chicken tikka after 11pm delicious ,good

 Noise from the street Location brilliant very close to tube Nice room and very friendly staff but noise from the street kept us awake ,good
 We were moved from our first room as there were a few things wrong with it this was dealt with very quickly and professionally but unfortunately we then had to move again the following night On the plus side we got to see 3 different rooms in the hotel all different all comfortable  Very friendly staff and a super location for visiting the museums It was also very peaceful for a city hotel apart from some rowdiness out on the street in the early hours of Sunday morning but that s not the hotel s fault There is a nice bar area and the rooms were comfortable with very well thought out lighting ,good

 My single room was small but very nice  Beautiful hotel in a good location walking distance from Paddington Station A bike rental was right there too The loaner phone was awesome they had food and bar service available I would stay there again ,good
No Negative Liked the location in that it is near the station and we use trains all the time Also having a metro right outside the door was great Rooms were very nicely appointed clean and well presented Breakfast had a wide selection of food A late check out of 12 noon made the booking very attractive and one of many reasons for us to return ,good
 Very small bathroom  Comfortable bed ,good
No Negative We asked about biscuits when we arrived and the staff got us some with a picture of fat boy slim who we were there it watch when we got back to the hotel Class ,good
 Hotel lovely but pillows uncomfortable Our room was next to lift shaft so first night sleep was disrupted and poor However the staff very helpful and we were moved to another area of hotel for remainder  Hotel in perfect location Easily accessible to all quarters Staff excellent ,good

No Negative Good staff Good location Good hotel ,good
No Negative The location was great especially for walking around the Barri G tic and El Born the staff were super friendly and helpful we even liked the nice touch of having some desserts left in the room for when we came back in the evening ,good

No Negative Antonio at the front desk was an exceptionally helpful host Will be back for sure ,good
No Negative We love the location of the hotel and the staff are always very friendly we do try to stay at the Mandeville when we visit London ,good
No Negative This is the second K K hotel I stayed at the other was in Barcelona It s a great boutique hotel The hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside You re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for London Would definitely stay here again ,good
 Very disappointed Booked this for family members and it was booked at the pay now price could have chosen the pay on arrival at hotel at cheaper price but wanted it paid for couple arriving Ended up they did not take the credit card payment as requested and charged the couple when they arrived They were very distressed by this as they had thought it was paid for in advance it just so happened they had a card with them that they were able to pay otherwise it would have used up a huge chunk of their spending money Why ask for prepayment when you are not going to take it All in all they enjoyed the stay and the room was lovely but this upset the start of their trip No Positive,good
 Nothing to note  Great location clean rooms and daily service ,good
No Negative The hotel was walking distance to theatre and other attractions The bed was huge and very comfortable Staff very helpful Only stayed one night but very pleased with the hotel ,good
 Everything that I booked again Excellent,good
 Perhaps if there was a cycling coach available I would have been less scared to cycle in Amsterdam I found it a daunting prospect  Surprised by the gym wish I brought some sneakers ,good
 Bed was a bit on the hard side for me  Great location great staff great room ,good
 This hotel was perfect  Pool and roof top terrace were superb ,good
 The only think that I would have liked would be a bath  The rooms are very modern and very clean The hotel has a very pretty and romantic feel to it Was unique and cute Didn t have the chain hotel feel to it which I like The most comfy bed ,good
No Negative Reasonable rate,good
 The window view was just to another wall and there was limited natural light There was no iron ironing board This was available as a service but the main ruined my partners top It was paid for but this is not the point  The best thing about this hotel is the location on the main street in Barcelona Staff are polite and professional The rooms are very comfortable and clean but miss facilities such as a desk ,good
 Towel quality was not reaching hotel rankings  Staff price and clean room ,good
 My only grumble is that my morning coffee and full English breakfast was served lukewarm I like both piping hot Apart from this I would recommend this hotel  Fab location Friendly staff,good
 Rooms could use a coffee tea kettle and mugs extra pillows Location is a little far from metro stations so be prepared to walk or take taxis  Nice hotel that had it all Especially liked the breakfast and the healthy diet corner with great variety Pool is very nice ,good

 Pool furniture was old and uncomfortable Room was lovely staff were really friendly really good location,good
 It is a bit further away from the centre although there is a bus that you catch at the door and leaves you close from St Stephen s cathedral  Cosy room renewed hotel Don t be put off by the exterior the interior is quite beautiful ,good
 Compulsory blockage of funds for potential expenses  Perfect location for a weekend tour ,good
 Loved everything  The location was great and the hotel was great Everyone was nice and the service left nothing to be desired A travelers wish Thank you Baltimore Hotel They even allowed a late check out and stored our luggage while we roamed a bit more ,good
 the lift broke down in which my son got stuck in there for 15 minutes on the Monday evening around 9pm  enjoyed my stay would recommend to my family and friends ,good
No Negative amazing breakfast ,good
 on leaving our room to go out in the evening just by chance i checked if our door was locked normally locks behind you this was not the case we could have been robbed i phoned reception and the matter was delt with promplty no apology on check out lovely hot cookies on arrival swift checkin excellant breakfast,good
 being shuffled to another hotel at the time of check in and back next morning we travel all the time and have been to around 70 countries and always book everything in advance month or two or even more we heard from taxi drivers and people overbooking is a common practice in London NOTE at the time of booking I mentioned our flight arrives around 9pm and we will be at the hotel late around midnight We have stayed in many hotels in London mostly around Oxford street or Knightsbridge in the past  location and cleanliness ,good
 Did not like that we could not use it he same key for both rooms in our family apartment The doors do not stay open and lock automatically making checking on the children and communicating between our rooms difficult Elevators are very small and slow  I liked having a separate room for the kids The beds were comfortable The staff was excellent very accommodating Rooms very clean ,good
 Unfortunately My room s AC is not cold even I set up the temperature to 18 with the highest fan n of course with room s card on otherwise the electricity will not on  Location the size of the triple room the breakfast,good
 Breakfast could have had a toaster and some cereal comment from the wife I thought it was spot on Very modern and stylish,good
 Nothing  Yes the croissants were the best l ever had Bed and shower can t be better Cleanliness the best ,good
No Negative Great atmosphere converted school to a boutique hotel Room was great not too small at all Mini fridge stocked with water daily Cozy bathrobes wonderful shower 5 minute walk to the tube ,good
 The furniture was a bit old The breakfast is too expensive with 18 Euro Bakerys and Caf s are offering a breakfast for less than 10 Euro For 12 Euro as instance I guess that the most would prefer to have breakfast at the hotel  The reception staff was very friendly and perfect English speaking I liked also the briefing with the first lessons in Spanish on a card Good idea The room was very clean The terrace bar on the top of the roof was great with excellent food and with a very friendly bar keeper Excellent staff at the hotel and you really feel welcomed ,good
No Negative Didn t take breakfast ,good
No Negative The staff was really good and place clean and nice,good
 It was really annoying I asked and asked for breakfast tea bags and milk as they were not refreshed each day in our room House keeping simply wouldn t do it When I asked at front desk I got hot milk and green tea Really Small things make a big difference  We were upgraded to a superior bedroom Location was fantastic city was fantastic ,good
 Electric fan in room was noisy  Location staff room ,good
No Negative The location of the hotel,good
 Rooms sometimes a little bit damaged walls corners doors but acceptable Nice hotel good location friendly staff,good
 Our room was good beautiful deco but it had no windows  Staff was particularly helpful the room was ok with a great bathroom The location is just perfect ,good
 Buying a Christmas ornament from the gift shop which was taken off the shelf not from behind the counter Shame to end on a bad note waiting for our bags that were supposed to be bought down from our room Waited half an hour asked 3 different people and resulted in missing our transport  All a pleasant experience from the bed to the interior ,good
 Room was smaller then expected On the other side there was a microwave But this got overheated And in our room was a refridgerator that didn t cool  Quiet location near Supermarket and metro Clean ,good
 Carpet a little worn out but to be expected in a busy London hotel Sound insulation is definitely inferior compared to likes of Premier Inn you can hear your neighbours and vice versa The room was in the basement or lower ground floor with blackout curtains and some sort of window shade so you could not see outside The lack of natural light meant that if you haven t set your alarm you might wake up as I did at 9am thinking it is still only 4am If you are expected to check out by a certain time this may be problematic Also in the morning without the option of having a window to open you feel as though can hardly breathe and need to escape well before your check out is due We did not pay for the breakfast as for 15 a head this did not represent good value for money in line with the room rate and there were better alternatives elsewhere  Easy check in Friendly and attentive staff including a phone call we received from the receptionist to the room 5 minutes after check in to ensure we were satisfied with it though perhaps a more personal touch by door knocking wouldn t go amiss but that is just my preference and I expect others prefer to be left alone Compact room size but clever use of space The complimentary fruit and water bottles are a nice touch as well as tea and coffee facilities The overhead shower was a welcome surprise and the bathroom and bedroom decor was first rate or at least what one would expect of a four star hotel The price we paid via booking was also very good value for money ,good
No Negative All staff at the hotel were exceptional They gave a first class service and were extremely friendly and helpful,good
 Food from room service was not good Receptionist that was on after 9pm barely spoke English and couldn t understand me  Location Comfortable room personal wi fi hotspot in room,good
 Very basic breakfast A strange smell in the room Good location very close to the metro station Big room with good facilities Staff very helpful ,good
 Over priced Travelled alone and initially given a very small double bed in an extremely small room At in excess of an average of 160 per night this was unacceptable Requested a refund to reflect the size of room but offered an alternative twin room instead Will be visiting Barcelona regularly and will hesitate to use booking com again instead deal with any hotel direct If the price was reasonable would consider this hotel again  It was clean ,good
 We ate elsewhere as booking for evening dinner was only evailable very late in the night Breakfast was very expensive so again we dined out Browns of St Martins Lane did a complete breakfast for 10 10 and was very acceptable  The warm welcome from the commissionaire and the helpful staff Being able to see the river and the snug warm comfort of the room and fitments and fixture The bathroom shower and wash basin were of the expected standard and the whole was comparable favourably to our last stay before the facelift took place ,good
No Negative Upgraded for birthday Pool and sauna good after day out before heading out for cocktails ,good
 You need a boat straight to the 02 and that would be perfect  Brilliant staff and lovely place to stay I left my jacket there on Sunday 13th December and you posted it free of charge and it arrived on Tuesday Thank you very much for your help,good

 The floors creaked a lot To me it looked like an old property with new furnishings The key cards were broken a lot of times although it could be replaced with no problem Didn t feel much like a 4 star hotel  The staff was really friendly and helpful The location is really in the middle of the busy part of the city very well accessible ,good
 No areas to really relax either than bedroom Excellent breakfast choice,good

No Negative Great hotel and stayed in a lovely room 2 minutes walk from the tube and Buckingham Palace ,good
 As with all these sorts of hotels more effort could have been made to enclose the bathroom for privacy We are very good friends so it wasn t a problem though it shouldn t really have been a consideration  The location was great The room was small and functional but effort had been made to make it comfortable and stylish Checking in out was really easy and I appreciated being able to pick my room on arrival The free list of films to watch was a welcome bonus especially as there were plenty of new releases included ,good

No Negative Awesome location Close to station to metro good rooms everything was great ,good
 small room amazing breakfast ,good
 A very confusing organisation It s not run like a normal hotel and very little information is given to guests regarding dining arrangements hotel facilities and what a guest is entitled to as part of their booking The policy of taking a deposit in addition to the room charge and only refunding it days after checking out is both perverse and unnecessary  Location location location You save so much time and effort when so many of London s must see sites are within a short walk of the hotel ,good
 Nothing really  Breakfast bed cleanliness easy to public transportation We liked the place and want to reserve for October ,good
No Negative Coolest place in Vienna Awesome roof top bar great food funky decor and really helpful staff Central location for museums and galleries would highly recommend ,good

 It s a bit out of the way for tourist areas Not a problem in nice weather when you can walk but in winter you need a taxi to go anywhere Beautiful hotel and very friendly and competent staff,good
 size of the swimming pool and the limited parking spaces location,good
 Walls of room way to thin big drawback heard every sound from next door including someone snoring  Location very good,good
 Bit of a distance from city centre although just 5 minutes from train station  Staff very helpful Breakfast very good,good
 The Rain shower s top quality although it needs to be looked after which speaks for the hotel as a whole TBH The shower head needs to be cleaned more often I resorted to cleaning it myself I shouldn t have had to ask for complimentary items such as toothbrush diffuser or bathrobes on arrival or wait half an hour for them to show Room smelt of cigarettes too you should probably remind customers about this in the room itself Don t leave everything to the iPad a booklet would do The iron and ironing board wasn t of great 5 star quality you would expect though it got the job done Trouser press or steam iron would be a good option too Hotel branding s disappointing for a boutique but the interior decor made up for this Lose the terrible vinyls on the wall in the room s as its really dated iPad functionality needs speakers in the room and ability to play local radio or Spotify My room Ultimate Lux King included a continental breakfast one of the main reasons for my booking However I the app should notify you what time breakfast is served at The girl I spoke to at reception had to double check too Breakfast lacked variety and was served with paper napkins It did not include the Cappuccino I had albeit listed on the menu For you to charge me 3 82 against my knowledge and then add grats on top is fairly outrageous 4 30 for a cappuccino is rather extortionate and to not even be notified about it even when ordering is quite frankly unacceptable Even though it is only 4 30 I m sure it all adds up Lounge and reception area needs more comfortable seating Great room but eat elsewhere  Bedding was super comfortable The room size was better than expected considering the location of the hotel Bathroom is stocked with complimentary Noble Isle which was good to see Everything can be ordered through iPad and Smart TV a great feature and very clever though remove the surname to make it more personal If you need something urgently speak to Reception directly or on the phone Balcony was terrific really peaceful if you do choose to book get one ,good
 Our stay was disappointing due to the attitude of the breakfast staff Very poor service  All good lovely room very clean Helpful reception staff Good parking facilities ,good
 Corridors is overused carpets Obvious location but be ware when use tramway because they do a maintenance some tram not go there,good

 I would have possibly tried the restaurant if there was a menu option for children there may well have been an option if I had asked but looking at the menu in our guest book I didn t get the impression there was something for children I enjoyed the whole experience of the visit from arriving the staff were very welcoming and helpful The room was beautiful and was better than I had imagined It had everything we needed and more It was a compact room and was indeed compact but it was perfect for 2 of us Every member of staff I came across throughout the stay always made an effort to say hello and asked if we needed anything The hotel was spotless and couldn t find any fault what so ever ,good

 Stayed in hotel 4 times in last 12 months longest stay 5 days with my wife as its convenient and its comfortable and the only minor complaint is pretty much you get ignored after you have checked in initially when you are coming going in reception with no eye contact smiles or hellos ever from staff on desk Possibly the ground floor is used by many non residents caf meeting place and that s a distraction but its really a stark contrast to when your booking in its as if no your here who cares It does leave you feeling disappointed A lot of staff do adopt a head down approach task over service generally and its the reception desk chatting to each other rather than acknowledging the customer by saying hello when you come in and even the bar team sometimes struggling to smile that lets the place down that s why I don t dine there or use the bar and go out more than I sometimes would i d sum it up in a word impersonal at times bit like a tube station  Location room standards great breakfast room service great help checking in friendly courteous and shower bath room always well provided for with basic toiletries and towels immaculate Great tv channels to watch as well Room service is pretty prompt and the guys who attend are always really polite and friendly ,good
 Could have used more shelf space in the bathroom And shower vs bathtub  Decor was fun ,good

 The room s view location The staff should informed me during the checking in that the room will view to the intrnal yard Which I may ask them for upgradeNo Positive,good
 The interior design is a tragedy New lobby looks really dull and cheap Like a cheap 4 star hotel in developing country The old rooms are not only old fashioned 90ties style but also ridiculously designed shower with no handle washbasin tap so high that a 6 year old cant reach it It needs a serious refurbishment Overall experience is definitely not reflecting an European 5 star quality  The location is perfect In the very center still quiet and calm The checkin was a bit slow and we had to change the room but the support of the hotel service guy was excellent Most dedicated man i have ever met He saved the good opinion about the hotel The value for money is very nice ,good

No Negative The staff especially Peter from reception were very helpful,good
 What makes the hotels location interesting lively and buzzing unfortunately also makes it not nice It s located 500 metres from the Moulin Rouge and a whole street of sex shops where we were propositioned to enter sex clubs and were offered drugs by dubious looking characters This area is easy to avoid but the overspill from that area does get to the hotel area Breakfast is EUR19 pp Not worth this price  This Hotel was fantastic A real little boutique hotel Great bar restaurant breakfast area Our room was very small but the d cor was really nice Bathroom fine The staff were all really helpful A young competent team Great bars and restaurants nearby A bit tricky to get to the River and the Tourist hotspots if you don t plan in advance ,good

 Breakfast needs some improvement And the bathroom is really old  Perfect location near Kensington gardens and Natural history museum Not far either from Royal Albert Hall so it s perfect if you want to go to a concert Bed was good neighborhood is surprisingly calm,good
 Toilet alone in a bathroom that does not have a shower or sink which are in different locations Strange architectural design but OK I guess  Location Friendliness Free snacks all day Room space ,good
 There was noise from the street There is a small restaurant across the street and the people from there were making lots of noise every evening We asked to changed the room but they haven t had any free The room sound isolation was very poor and you could hear people from other rooms flushing toilets and cars passing by on the street  Amazing breakfast Room service is also good missed Sangria Great personnel ,good

 They did get our room booking wrong on arrival and could not find our second room they switched our rooms to allow for twin beds for one of our party who was pregnant but then gave another guest the same room and the guest walked into our room unannounced thinking it was their room apparently something wrong with the system we ordered two beers on room service and they never arrived 2 hours later we went down and cancelled them and they still appeared on the bill the following day so we had to explain again that we never received them Having said all of this they did correct where they went wrong and were very amenable  I loved the style ambience and staff in this hotel It s charming relaxing and in the perfect spot for exploring the restaurants and shops nearby Additionally Hoxton recommend places to frequent such as eateries and spa s three of which we tried and thoroughly enjoyed ,good

 we were not told in advance to going out for the evening that the bars were closed that evening for a private party so we went out for dinner and when we came back to have a drink in the bar we were told we could only go back to our room for a drink which was very disappointing if we had been warned of this we could of planned to stay out later  Loved the style of the hotel and personnel touches pool area was lovely and had 2 great massages The gym was impressive and mini bar was great ,good
 Breakfast space is far too small for the number of guests We had to go back and forth with our plates tea and juices from the breakfast room to the restaurant where we were seated as there was no space Long check in and check out queues Room doors are difficult to close so most of the guests were slamming them  Big modern rooms Staff at the reception desk was very nice Very conveniently located next to the train station We took the S4 train and reached Milan city centre in 15 min you can use the same ticket for the metro and the price is the same as it is in the urban zone ,good
 Massive bathroom yet tiny toilet closet  Perfect location quiet but only 5 mins walk to the city square 10 mins to red light district Great service and room cleaning Small touches that not all 4 hotels offer e g porter and reception look after keys Free tea coffee biscuits and pastries,good

 Room service was a bit inconsistent Best location functionality cleanliness,good
No Negative Location was good staff at all levels were helpful friendly and happy ,good
 Room Too bare Needs refurbishing Needs more amenities  Location Very accessible to major places you would want to see or visit in Paris Gives one a feeling of being in a safe place to stay out even in the middle of the night which we did Not crowded but close enough to the real local population ,good
 Breakfast was good usual continental selection but on reflection I wouldn t pay for that again as the local eateries are that good and open really early There are many cafes bakeries and restaurants that serve breakfast relatively cheap  Location was spot on Close enough to travel everywhere by foot also good tram and bus links with a bike rental shop just a few minutes walk away Far enough away from the busy area for a good night s sleep ,good
No Negative Everythink v good,good
 I stayed here maybe more then 5 times But this time was not the best Madam in the room service couldn t properly understand what we wanted she couldn t even repeat our order properly and we needed to call on reception so they could take our order and they still made mistake and gave us two omelet s instead of one And then in the middle of the day we wanted to eat in restaurant and girl on reception said that we can eat in restaurant Also she clarified that when we were talking to her She said even if the restaurant is closed but it was open as she said we can eat in the bar the same menu from restaurant and she also clarified that when we were hanging on the phone and waiting she to clarified that When we came down in 5 minutes in the restaurant they said that it is already closed We starting to explain that we called on reception and girl calrified for us that it is open Restaurant just said sorry So we asked to eat the same menu at the bar and they said that it is not possible D LOL We saw our waiter from the small lobby bar and asked her if it is possible she said not but she said that we can eat room service menu at the bar if we wanted So she helped us to eat that day Thank s to her  This is really one of the best hotels I ve ever been And the best Hyatt in Europe for sure Very clean and with super beds The gym and spa are on the very high level and they really like their guests ,good

No Negative Upgrade on arrival,good
 We were slightly disappointed that we had to ask for supplies of towels and robes to be given in sufficient quantities we expected that housekeeping in a hotel of this standard would get this right Some people may think the road outside a little noisy maybe request a quiet room  The hotel was in a really good location and the atmosphere was great We enjoyed exploring the area around the hotel it was just a 10 minute walk from Spitalfields 10 mins from Old Street and Liverpool Street Stations and was surrounded by countless cool eateries and bars All tastes were catered for Overall though a great hotel in an ideal location ,good

 Everything was ok only the staff on the receptino desk was not so kind No Positive,good
 Nothing but if I have to say something the desk chair was very tatty and worn easy and cheap to replace and it would be 10 10 oh and one more thing the breakfast plates are too small The view from the room was perfect as our daughter was doing a topic at school on Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament,good
 lacking in any view from the triple bedroom which costs more  Friendly staff and good prompt service Fantastic location ,good
 The breakfast was disappointing the cooked food wasn t replenished lots of empty trays no one available to cook eggs  Really comfy bed ,good

 The carpets in the corridors and in the room were an unattractive colour and design they looked fairly worn The trolleys with room cleaning materials were often left in the corridors to the rooms all day I only remember seeing them tidied away once The storage space in the room was limited only a couple of highish shelves in the wardrobe for any clothes that weren t hung up I m not sure how we would have got two suitcases into the room Our fairly modest one had to nestle between our outdoor coats  The breakfast was excellent Eggs various types delicious and cooked to order It was a nice gesture to have tea coffee and cake available for free from 3 pm to 6 pm and similarly Punch with Lebkuchen from 6 pm to 9 pm The hotel was very conveniently situated for the Swedenplatz U Bahn also close enough to walk to the Stephansdom and yet out of the at this time of year crowded centre ,good

 Seems to be NH Hotel Group policy to provide slow internet connections in order to achieve extra revenues by getting people to sign up for the premium wife I paid the extra surcharge for faster internet 9 99Euros per day however internet was still not properly working Would expect more from a 4 star Hotel Design rather dry not recommended for couples Businesshotel  Spacious Room Very Clean Staff friendly Location close to the city center good connections ,good

 Some staff couldn t understand english Lovely hotel wil stay here again,good
No Negative The general ambiance as well as the attitude of the staff ,good
 Hotel rooms were gained by outside access unable to double lock door from inside so felt unsafe Door handle also loose and shower base filled with water 2 Members of breakfast staff weren t very friendly  Close to Metro station on main line into city centre easy to find Hotel room large clean and comfortable Good choice at buffet breakfast Good hotel if you plan to be out and about sightseeing wouldn t recommend if you re looking for a hotel to relax in as there isn t really a bar area ,good

 Real coffee in room  Comfy rooms Very helpful staff Lovely cake and coffee shop in foyer a real treat ,good
 Room isn t that spacious compared to the room I previously stayed in at the Hoxton at Shoreditch and it was 55 more expensive We had a late 9pm midweek meal at The Hubbard and bell restaurant It wasn t that busy but staff left us waiting for ages to pay our bill We asked two different members of staff for it and could see them all standing around at the front Eventually we had to get up and go to the front to pay on our way out  Very comfortable bed like the breakfast bag Super friendly staff ,good
 Food breakfast very poor quality Location staff,good
 they plan on changing breakfast buffet to a far less of an attractive menu ambiance great breakfast buffet,good
 The bathroom was small for the size of the room but not sure much can be done about that And also the shower head could be bigger Giving the standard of the room the shower head could use an upgrade Also downstairs slamming of doors was a bit annoying and the loud music from the restaurant could be heard in our room These are all small things that were noticed but nothing too major to disrupt the stay  We were in a newly renovated room and it was lovely Decor was lush bed and pillows was super comfy and the room itself was more than accommodating Room service was delicious and the presentation of the food was fantastic This hotel goes above and beyond to accommodate I have stayed at other hotels in the area and payed more and they don t compare to this hotel Special thanks to Alexander for taking care of us The entire staff is superb ,good
 Noise due to refurbishment  Everything perfect,good
 The garage is a little tight for parking a long car if the garage is full lucky for me it was not  Location is near train station Remfe and Barcelona metro station access from Numancia street The walk across Malaga Park and you are at hotel Restaurant close by and reaso able rates ,good

 Just the wall art  Staff were great room was clean but decor was a little dated but maybe just not my taste Rate was ok for london i guess but perhaps a little much for the room size etc if compared to others,good
 The large porn selection also controlled from the iPad  Nice contemporary feel Great view from the room of Tower Bridge TV lights mood lighting blinds all controlled from the room s iPad ,good
 Some of the guests talked loudly after midnight when arriving to the hotel  The location is absolutely perfect if you enjoy being right next to La Boqueria market hall and old town ,good
 no window Excellence services nice staff great location,good
 Overpriced breakfast go to Exmouth Coffee round the corner instead for best coffee in London  Very comfortable bed which is my number one priority as business traveller Bar closed at 11pm but very accommodating staff allowed us room service downstairs ,good
 confusion about the breakfastbuffet No signs at all or staff saying that we were charged extra if we took food from one of the buffets Poor staff It seemed pretty uncomfortable for them as well as for the guests We told them at the frontdesk that signs could help a lot after we had a minor argument with one of the staff The breakfast was very good o  The hotel and the room was great Nice staff ,good
 More spacious rooms  Comfortable bed rich breakfast friendly staff ,good

 Nothing to complain about Position High street Kensington and tube at less than 5min walking Cleanliness,good

 A bit more variety in the lounge bar would be great I couldn t get a proper whiskey or better any whiskey at the bar Just this minor thing The staff was amazingly helpful offering detailed tips for city escapes always with a smile on their face Very cozy lounge area and great decoration The breakfast was very basic but enough to get you started Metro line M5 is right in front of the hotel Great value for money highly recommended,good
No Negative Beautiful bathroom and high quality amenaties,good
 why on earth do you charge for parking there is ample space to park in the area for free great river view room is relatively small but very comfortable,good
 The reception area was a tad confusing when we arrived and also we did not have any sweetner or t bags given after day1 even though we were there for 3 days  we like that the rooms were quiet and that people were not slaming doors or making noise we like the location and the bar near the reception,good
 Rooms rather small  Newly renovated boutique hotel a few meters from Gare du Nord Very nice clean rooms very sound proof Perfect airco Exceptionally friendly staff ,good

No Negative Loved it all,good
 I would have liked to have a bit more gluten free options in the restaurant menu but we were able to bring in our food into our rooms so that wasn t such a big deal Still it would have been nice to eat at the hotel restaurant at least once  I loved the room and the staff The room was extremely comfortable and we had tea making facilities which suited my mother very well The staff were so friendly and helpful They did their best to help us out whenever we had any queries ,good
 Nothing Welcomed by lovely staff Maria was just a delight after a long 24hr flight Was upgraded to spotless modern comfortable room with balcony Breakfast excellent Great location surrounded by cafes restaurants and beautiful buildings Ask for upper floor if street noise bothers you but rooms well insulated Expensive but worth it ,good
No Negative Excellent facilities 5 minutes walk to Duomo perfect air conditioning surprising breakfast with variety of food cheese fruits berries etc ,good
 The mini bar wasn t stocked Also there were lots of little issues in the spa the attendant wasn t very helpful friendly there weren t any slippers available a speaker was broken and kept making horrible noises there was no water in the sauna Nothing major but a shame as with a few small fixes it would have been lovely  This hotel is really great value for money the facilities size of room and views are brilliant compared to what you get for the same price in central London We were delighted with the service we went for our anniversary and upon arrival found we had been bumped up the penthouse for free They had also left us chocolate covered strawberries and a card Lovely personal touches which absolutely made our day The restaurant downstairs has great views and the food is pretty good The spa is v relaxing ,good

No Negative The size of the bed was great Very impressed with the overall cleanliness ,good
 Art or decor in the room just to make it look a bit more inviting The room was really spacious,good
 For nearly 200 per night I think breakfast should be included in the price  We stayed in a standard room but this was quite spacious and well presented We were in a first floor room but considering it s location the noise from outside was neglible ,good
No Negative The hotel is great Marriott hotels are my favourite ones And this one is not an exception Everything was great during my stay ,good

No Negative Beautiful hotel in a good location Very friendly and helpful staff ,good
 Hotel refused to give iron on demand For business travellers ironing a bit of clothes to give proper shape is essential service which generally all good hotels give  most of it ,good
 On arrival the hotel had already taken one nights payment for each of 3 rooms I d booked I assumed this would be taken off the full cost but I was told by a rude and unhelpful receptionist this was not he case so despite having already paid 458 I was expected to still pay the full amount and the 458 would be refunded although she had no idea when and there was no one there who would know 5 days later I am still waiting for this refund An unexpected extra expense on my arrival  The bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly nice clean accommodation good location,good

No Negative Lovely local area near Gaudis park,good
 The bed I had was very hard There was some noise during the night from staff carrying out their duties which woke me as we were in a basement room but this would not deter me from returning  The staff were most helpful very pleasant and accommodating Although there were no tea making facilities in the room tea was brought to the room very soon after being ordered as often as desired free of charge The food was delicious and plentiful Everywhere was clean and the bathroom had marble on walls and floor Our room had doors opening onto a small courtyard The hotel was only a few minutes walk from the tube station and the building itself looks splendid I would stay there again ,good
 At times difficult to find  The service was superb with people greeting us as we walked in Room was excellent more than I expected ,good
 Dulness of reservation officer  Jazz Bar of the hotel breakfast decoration of the rooms everything except dulness of reservation officer ,good
 The bed was a little hard and the pool closed at 7pm Staff were very friendly and facilities were good ,good
 Nothing Personal touch from staff,good
 Nothing Both our bedroom and bathroom were well equipped spacious and comfortable I can not imagine what else you could possibly want for breakfast that is not on offer here The staff are welcoming and consistently helpful The plan of the hotel is such that although you are in an excellent location right by the cathedral the rooms face in to bijou courtyards and are therefore not affected by the action right outside the front door Superb ,good
 Too small room Good location Breakfast ,good
 Just one for me catastrophic problem was that in most of the rooms the windows are hermetically sealed with no opening I find it impossible to sleep in a room without access to fresh air even if somewhat diesel laden Once I discovered this was the case I found out that there were a few rooms with terraces which of course did have opening French doors so I had to pay for an emergency upgrade at 30 extra This for me of course reduced the value for money as I had to pay more for access to fresh air a commodity I view as standard  Stylish decor with a quirky edge Very clean and well maintained Comfortable bed good sized main room and bathroom Well lit mirror with power point for hair and make up Despite busy location on a plaza with shops restaurants and cinema it was surprisingly quiet for sleeping Excellent continental breakfast with good strong coffee and lots of choice Fresh fruit cereals bread ham cheese smoked salmon pastries etc plus cooked breakfast option for a small extra fee Good value More than all that the staff were really lovely and created a great welcoming ambience I felt very happy and comfortable as a solo traveller which counts for a lot ,good
No Negative Awesome value and comfort The interface with the hotel before our arrival was a bonus as was the free phone We ll be back ,good
No Negative Our first time travelling with our baby so we booked a larger room Due to a computer problem reception were not immediately able to find our booking But came back after 10 minutes and gave us an upgrade to an apartment due to the inconvenience Stayed at this hotel a few times Location is simply fantastic 2 minutes from Victoria so getting around is simple ,good

No Negative Feeling very special ,good
 Tea coffee making facility in room please Great hotel quiet had good sleep great shower lovely helpful staff In good interesting location Enjoyed the framed illustrations around hotel and room Pleasant waiting relaxing area ,good
 Eating in the Great Hall is essentially a university dining hall not for everyone Plus access to the rooms in the main building might be problematic for anyone unsteady on their feet  I love the location and the building Plus the wonderful Great Hall is a fabulous place to eat Very Harry Potter ,good
No Negative The reception extremely helpful and friendly ,good

 I was asked for 16 for wifi that was supposed to be free I was told that I should have registered to get it free A suggestion How about telling the guests that when they check in not when they check out Not impressed Food was only average for a four star expected moreNo Positive,good
 very costly parking in a multi storey if you are nipping in and out of the car park if you are parking up and not moving again then you will pay 15 do not like the way they seperate breakfast from the room charge  Nice hotel as you would expect for a Hilton and right next door to the arena ,good
No Negative The view from bedroom window was amazing ,good
 Could Do With Air Conditioning Size of bedrooms were great,good
 Nothing to dislike The hotel is very well position for all the plans we had for visiting Milan The staff are so helpful and go out of their way to accommodate your requests We had a trip out very early in the morning before breakfast was being served They made a breakfast up for us to collect at 6 30 in the morning from reception ,good
 The bed was too hard for my husband  The room was good clean staff was very pleasant ,good
 Breakfast needs to be improved I would recommend to give more options for vegetarians  It was very comfortable bed perfect cleaning service and unbelievably helpful friendly staff I arrived early check in time but my room was ready and I was able to relax before meeting after the flight It wasn t expected but very pleasant ,good
 Outside restaurant Great staff at reception ,good
 Nothing Very comfortable and good location,good
 Limited parking and expensive valet although all valet is very expensive in London approx US 70 per night I believe  Great hotel Modern Comfy Clean and Luxury Location good Great value ,good
 We were initially cold in the room Took a long time to get warm Television maximum volume was set too low for older people without the sharpest of hearing plus we couldn t hear the TV at all with the central heating on fan  Loved location public rooms the welcome and the breakfast was perfect Will definitely stay there again We always like to stay in a Hilton by Doubletree where possible ,good
 broken lift it happens so no big deal really Disappointing breakfast Lounge and library areas Night staff really helpful and friendly with my late check in ,good
 The spa facilities weren t excellent The jacuzzi didn t work it was just like sitting in a warm bath The pool and sauna were nice though The room was a bit noisy due to our room overlooking the atrium but it didn t bother us too much  The hotel is in a great location to easily access all of the sights The staff were friendly and helpful The beds were super comfy although we had a room overlooking the atrium which got a little bit noisy when people were leaving or returning to the hotel even though our room was on the 4th floor ,good
No Negative Location and friendly staff Delicious breakfast too ,good
 Nothing very pleased overall  The quirky feel of the hotel ,good
 Small room Location,good
 Unfortunately the restaurant is closed on Sunday evening but there are plenty of good eating places nearby so it didn t matter  Warm welcome and comfy bed valet parking service,good
No Negative Stuff is very friendly and helpful The location away from city center made us stay out all day and bike a lot which was nice ,good
 Quite expensive for the room size long wait for food at breakfast Great location lovely staff,good
 The view from the room on a roof with all kinds of pipes is not worthy of the hotel and its location No Positive,good
 check in was long and confusedNo Positive,good
 The night shift one middle aged man on the receptions is terrible It took exactly 30 minutes in the middle of the night to check in to two rooms and he tried to charge 30 EUR more for our stay after long argument he gave up The rooms facing the inner part of the hotel a noisy because of the breakfast After complaining they put us into another room  Very good location and breakfast The rooms are also very nice and modern ,good
 It would have been nice to have slightly more coffee and complimentary water in the room Note too that the entire building is non smoking and the hotel does not sell alcohol This is actually almost a bonus in my eyes but might be an issue for some travelers  I loved this hotel I was staying for a few nights around NYE and was looking for somewhere that would be close to the city but still calm and peaceful This was perfect it s right beside a tram line that goes to all the major tourist attractions but is itself in a residential neighborhood It also offers easy access to the airport which is always a bonus The room was a perfect size for two and boasts a Nespresso coffee machine comfortable beds a good sized wardrobe and a decent work space essential for those of that always have some kind of work to do I only bought breakfast twice during my stay as 15 seemed a little expensive but really it was worth it in terms of quality and choice ,good
 All great  Bed was definitely amazingly comfortable and the view was fab ,good
No Negative Everything about his hotel made it one of our best ever hotel experiences in the world,good
 TV has only 3 English channels no instruction how to get other English speaking channels movies I will book at NR next trip  The bread coffee machine and everything else Like the International Herald newspaper ,good

No Negative staff were friendly the room was clean the bed was comfortable Would defiantly come again ,good
 The suprise 200 deposit on arrival and charged our room to card when we asked to pay with the cash we had Room,good
 The room could be a little more silent  Everything was just perfect Across the street from Gare Saint Lazare wallking distance to Opera Garnier Galeries Lafayete and even the Louvre if you are willing to walk for 20 min ,good
 Had to pay extra for breakfast and for a double bed rather than 2 single beds but I guess that s pretty standard  Easy check in and out Good breakfast Close to tram stops Clean rooms ,good
 Room was next to reception so loud on a morning Breakfast was poor choice  Convenient location and good value for money One or two night stay max,good
 A very teeny elevator room for two thin people Location to all major sites coming back to our room in the evening to see fresh towels low lights and music playing,good
 The breakfast selection and breakfast service left much to be desired  Loved the room and location,good
No Negative Everything was excellent staff breakfast location clean I absolutely recommended,good
 The pool could have been open longer it closed at 8pm and with a better selection of food bar snacks suitable for children I asked weeks in advance for a top floor room so as not to be disturbed by guests above us but they would not commit to this for me Some of the staff on the front desk were a little abrupt but generally they were helpful  The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on I had the best night s sleep The area around the hotel was very pleasant and lots of lovely cafes within a very short walking distance Metro stop just outside very useful Lovely rooftop pool and deck with stunning views It was spotlessly clean Food was delicious Rooms were large and so were the beds ,good
No Negative The location and the comfort,good
 The loud music on both Friday and Saturday which lasted until early morning but as a member of staff said This is Camden sIr Understood but this puts me of off using hotel again certainly at weekends Easy access from hotel to many good restaurants and to tube stations,good
 Coffee in room Spacious room and friendly staff,good
No Negative Lovely cosy hotel next to the Moulin Rouge The owners have been very clever at utilising the small space available The location is very central and we were able to visit all the major attractions by foot ,good
 King size executive didn t have a view only a brick wall with other windows room 479 Clean Friendly excellent location ,good
 My only small complaint is a very tiny one checking in there is no restroom nearby easily accessable My young son had to use the facilities pretty badly after being on the train then the metro then the walk to the hotel and there was nowhere close for him to go The man checking us in told me it wouldn t take long and he could go in the room but for a little boy even the fairly simple check in process was a while to wait and I wish he the staff member would have had a better option for us Maybe he could have taken us to the room and let us fill out the paperwork there Just a suggestion and honestly this was a small issue and the only one we had during our stay  The beds were crazy comfortable even the pull out sofa that my son slept on which I was wholly surprised by Pullouts are usually pretty uncomfortable just as a rule but I wouldn t have minded sleeping on this one at all Our bed in the next room was even more comfortable we stayed in a Jr suite I liked that there was a mini bar with snacks and drinks These are always fairly pricey so that wasn t a surprise and it was a very nice convenience option to have The building was beautiful and well maintained It was clean and smelled nice There were plenty of outlets for charging devices as well as a well appointed kitchen with utensils plates glasses anything we could have needed The female staff member who checked us out was so sweet and kind and made us very comfortable We will definitely stay here again on our next trip to Paris ,good
 Checking in took quite some time There was no clear queue and both people at the desk were not communicating about this queue  Very nice room They also have allergen free rooms Everything looks new Breakfast was good but not very special ,good
 Pool was v small and v cold  Lovely up to date clean hotel,good
No Negative Friendly helpful staff,good
 Room was quite small as was the bathroomNo Positive,good
 The room was too small for two person and it was over furnished  The room was equipped with the best accessories and amenities The bed was very comfortable the location really central and quite The gym was very well organized and well equipped The 108 brasserie perfect for the aperitive time ,good
 The staff were very helpful and the accommodation was perfectNo Positive,good
 The rooms we were allocated were tiny Unfortunately the floor was the only place to put our cases and that meant we had to keep walking over it to get to the other side of the room Limited free wifi for one device only As we were visiting from overseas this was quite restrictive and particularly so for a family of four  Location is excellent and the bar area is great Doormen were lovely ,good
 No kettle in the room The worst sound proofing I ve ever experienced in a hotel The walls must be Paper thin You can hear everyone in all the rooms around you not good Very difficult to get a good sleep as a result  Good location very smart double room with balcony Nespresso machine a nice touch ,good
 A complimentary shuttle bus to the airport  The hotel had a little tuk shop very handy for nibbles and bits to eat the decking area out back on the river was great to for meals out doors when the weather allows the metro station is only a short walk away from the hotel ,good
No Negative Bed and bedding were one of the best ive seen in hotels,good
 Shower flooded staff at breakfast were cold Location comfort of bed breakfast reception staff,good
 nothing Everything,good

No Negative Very clean new 3 minute walk to an amazing view of the Eiffel Tower some great cafe s etc ,good
 The view was not great but this is central London and many hotels have rooms which face onto an external atrium it really was not an issue at all The standard double room was a decent size The staff were excellent and could not have been more helpful The location is an excellent base for seeing London ,good
 The fact you have to pay 7 a day for use of wifi The room was very clean and the view was great,good
 Dining area Not enough places available for the size of the hotel and the layout was not very user friendly No labels on items so you didn t necessarily know what was in a dish Example the potato salad had ham in also food not in logical places e g a small salad item in glasses in the desserts Mostly everything,good
 Nothing Convenience to the SSe Arena,good
 Woke up the first morning to find there was no hot water Problem with a broken pipe was not rectified until the afternoon which prevented everyone from showering bathing When we checked out we asked if there was any adjustment to our bill for this huge problem they offered the Hyatt passport for any future stays at one of their hotels Not great considering it is after all a five star establishment  Lovely comfortable hotel have stayed here before ,good
 I requested a bath tub when booking a long time ago but the room allocation was not selected till we arrived when no such facilities were available even if we up graded to a suite I am sure that at the time of booking availability would have been easy Staff very efficient but not happy or at ease with residents  Thje location is superb for everything in central London for theatres restaurants shopping and the Thames ,good
 the advance calling before arriving personal aggression hotel staff very polite,good
 The wifi in the bedroom was impossibly slow to the point of being non existent It worked better downstairs in the reception area  The staff were helpful and cheerful Our bedroom was on the back overlooking a small but well maintained courtyard It was perfectly silent at night ,good
 Lack of glass drinking glasses Room bed breakfast and front desk staff ,good
 Extremely expensive breakfast clogged installation refused to turn the heat on even after a request  Location,good
No Negative Great location within 5mins walk from Metro train station Next door to Ajax Stadium My second time staying at this hotel so it must be good Hotel is very modern with lots of high tech features Breakfast is good with plenty on offer Hotel bar and restaurant is also very good with a nice selection of beers etc There are plenty of nice restaurants near by and also an excellent IMAX Cinema I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quality mid range option ,good
 Waited for almost 3 hours just for room to be ready at the time of checkin Very clean Close to metro,good
 Was given 2 Key Cards at Reception Went to where room was in the 8th floor Both Key Cards did not work Went down again to reception Only 1 reception staff in sight that afternoon Took a long time to finally get right key cards This after our long day travelling to Amsterdam No Positive,good
 The internet connectivity was appalling often falling over and when connected was reasonably unresponsive The concierge and hotel check in staff were excellent I felt I was the most important person there This made it a very enjoyable couple of days,good
 Breakfast to the room would be nice  The room was fabulous with a terrace with a great view room very spacious and clean Check in very efficient Staff are very helpful during the stay Check out at 5 30 in the morning very quick and the guy at the reception offered coffee on the go that was very nice of him Great job Will definitely come back ,good

 Nothing Everything,good
 Coffee making machine in bedroom poor the only fault i could make about my stay Breakfast excellent staff very helpful hotel very clean overall i will probably stay at the hotel again,good
 Dirty carpets and stains on bedding Free wifi,good
 My only slight criticism is that during breakfast which I accept was very busy the staff were quite slow to take our used plates and so we were often eating surrounded by dirty plates and bowls  The hotel was in a brilliant location the rooms were clean and very spacious and all the staff extremely helpful We ate in the hotel every night mostly having room service and the food was lovely ,good

 A little outdated reception service are poor But for Mayfair the rate of Millenium is ok  Good hotel worths its 4 star rate excellent location near Rits Green park Novikov Scot s 5 min walk to Selfridges Very suitable for business trip not for leisure Breakfast is good even better than in some 5 star hotels We stayed in club room and liked the size of bathroom All concierges are very helpful ,good
 The location is not perfect for new comers to find If you are carrying big luggages I won t recommend  Breakfast is good The bed and pillows are fantastic The only thing is that it locates at outskirt of the city You need 25 min metro and 10 min walking before you find it in a very quiet neighbourhood ,good
 It was a little far from the city centre  Very nice room with good facilities ,good
 Nothing Huge room high ceilings overlooking the courtyard in a beautiful older building The bathroom was nice luxurious with a comfortable bath and shower Staff was extremely friendly and always helpful In a great area away from all the tourist traps but surrounded by lots of restuarants cafes and shops About an 8 10 minute walk from the Metro with a tram stations just out front Complimentary water bottles everyday chocolates and chips Highly recommend and definitely worth a visit ,good

 I booked an offer on your site for an upgraded room for 168 and when we were given our room we were allocated a club room which was very small and feel a bit let down by booking com for offering rooms on there site which seem a good deal and then only getting the basic room will have to make sure in future if using your site to get a proper confirmation of what we booked apart from the let down with the room a great hotel The staff are fantastic,good
 The gentleman who checked us in was very good however on the second day the plug was stuck in the sink which meant that the water did not drain We reported it to the front desk and returned 5 hours later but there was no attemot to fix it so we ended up having to vail out water with a cup into the toilet The next day when we checked out we mentioned it to another member of staff on the desk who didnt even make a note of the problem  Breakfast was very good and prompt service location of hotel was exckent and lits if places to eat nearby,good
 There was no vegan choices for breakfast and we felt that that was a waste of money Other than that all good  The location and helpfulness of the staff was great ,good
 Not enough light in the room 2 ceiling lights were out of order  The best advantage of the hotel is it s location A step from the underground The neighborhood is calm has some nice restaurants and cafes a supermarket and a post office Pretty close to Hyde park and museums The hotel itself looks old Should be renovated a little Our room was of medium size Basic ,good
 We had breakfast over two mornings On both days when we left the table to get our cooked breakfast staff cleared away our juice and cutlery without checking that we were still in the dining room This was quite annoying The bar area and dining room were very good First room was noisy so they changed us to another room which was much better,good

 The hotel had only recently opened and they were still decorating the place Therefore expect some teething problems Some of the designer features in the room were not adequate e g a stool but no chair so difficult to work at the desk The space for breakfast seemed rather small and may get crowded when it gets busy  A clean reasonably priced hotel in the Place D Italie area It has a character lacking in bland chain hotels Friendly staff at front desk and breakfast A large TV with a large range of foreign channels Good lighting in the room ,good
 The pod style room room was functional but small although not a problem for one night Main issue though was the bed although very big and comfortable it literally took up one whole side of the room so the person sleeping on the inside had to climb over the other to get out We managed ok but obviously this could be problem for some people hence the only reason I have marked it down on comfort obviously they may not all be like this so would ask Also although there were cold drinks and snacks on the house which was nice it is always good to have tea and coffee making facilities although don t think there would have been room  Quirky and fun fresh and modern attractively designed hotel Massive bar and lounge area Very good value this was half price deal If you are in a hurry it is very good as you can use one of the many check in computers and do it all yourself although they are there to help I would definitely stay again Great location for Borough Market area ,good
 The toilet and the room as not very as clean as should be  The staff made the hotel they were so helpful and friendly ,good

 Room service was sub par My coffee cups were clearly just rinsed with water and not clean replaced with fresh cups Not all trash was taken out daily Water bottles coffee etc not replaced each morning which was disappointing as this was supposed to be provided with the room My door didn t require a key to enter at first meaning anyone could waltz right in as the battery died on the door unit This is very dangerous but was remedied right away and they sent someone to stand outside my door to make sure no one entered whilst I was out The internal lock didn t work so you couldn t lock the door from the inside but they did send someone right away to fix that He had to chisel the door frame down and play with the hinges Phones in the room didn t work this didn t get fixed but there was a handy mobile in the room For most problems staff were very helpful and prompt to remedy any issues house cleaning and phones excluded i didn t want to have to call reception again with yet another problem Biggest issue there was an additional charge on my room of over 500 as it hasn t gone through yet I can t comment on any resolve  I was upgraded to a room with a view of the square after being woken up 2 4 mornings I stayed there The room was spectacular Didn t want to leave The restaurant on the roof was awesome great food fantastic cocktails and delicious desert all with a nice old world glitzy view inside and a nice city view outside Yummy diffuser inside room letting of a nice scent was an added feature to the gadgets you get to play with depending on the type of room you stay in Prompt responses to issues I had with the room Mostly super friendly and helpful staff Complimentary spa access had I known I would have bought appropriate clothing to take advantage of this Great products inside bathrooms Elemis and Hermes ,good

 Nothing not to like  I stayed at Vignon in 2011 and decided to book it again during my recent visit to Paris What a great choice The hotel s location is perfect for walking to the main attractions the top floor room was freshly decorated with lots of natural daylight and immaculately clean We tried their breakfast on the last morning and it was perfectly adequate ,good
 we were charged for something we did not consume but after several emails with their staff it was reversed so all good  microwave oven in the room made it very convenient to reheat food making you save some money from eating in restaurants location was great very near the station and to the London Eye ,good
 The room was very small The bathroom was not very clean The shower water spilled out to the bathroom every time we took a shower The bathroom sink was dirty  The location is perfect for a city trip,good
 However we had no view and no phone reception and wifi was not good in the room Booked with yourself and I was the one who booked this in my name with my credit card but they had problem finding booking because it had been booked in my sisters name and her name was written the wrong way around E g Her first name had been used as surname  Location excellent for London trips etc and staff were good at reception,good
 For a foreigner it is difficult to understand very fast speaking non english personnel in the reception Everything correct but not a warm feeling However super service from the guy helping to catch a taxi but not so easy to understand him My suggestion is that more attention should be given to the language from some of the staff Or employ british personel  Fantastic location nice rooms ,good

No Negative The staff were absolutely wonderful We were made to feel very special ,good
 TVs are terrible for the odd hour or two you would want to spend in front of one The building is quite old so if you re a history buff you would find something to admire not so much for a modernist  Very very friendly staff especially Gabriel from reception who was very kind Overall a nice hotel but nothing supreme about the location or decor ,good

 Noise from metro Location,good
 First impressions are fundamental in the hotel industry and way our check in was handled was well below what we expec from Holiday Inn The person that checked us in clearly had no knowledge about a Booking com reservation and could not find our booking despite we giving her all elevant info Eventually excuse was that Booking com had not given our name correctly We indicated we use booking com often and never had any similar problem only to then be confronted by another staff person at reception that was rude and lacked any professional attitude Only when I threatened to report situation to both Booking com as well as to TripAdvisor to whom I write on a regular basis did then a Manager at my reqest did intervene and in a proper professional manner and offering an apology for the way the check in was handled but the damage of first impressions was done And this Manager whilst corteous professional still hinted that the confusion with the name was Booking com fault and I thus suggest that you do check with Holiday Inn this situation No Positive,good

 I didn t like that they would not give me rewards points for my stay because I booked through a third party site The neighborhood near the hotel is not really nice It didn t feel unsafe but a lot of unsightly apartment buildings  The hotel was close to public transportation tram line to city center The rooms were clean and comfortable There is also a small shopping center next door where you can get groceries and other items ,good

 Staff at front desk wasn t particularly helpful in responding to basic questions including about tourism in Milan  Very clean room and facilities But room itself a bit small ,good
 I was surprised by the lack of deligent cleaning of our hotel room As we were in the room only after a tiring day of museums and sightseeing it did not matter how clean it was However our room was not cleaned each day and when it was cleaned it seemed very poor The staff was very accomdating with everything else though extra blankets provided  Superb location when you have only a few days in Vienna It was also super easy to find from different directions as it is right next to St Stephen s cathedral Delicious breakfast which is a rare for me ,good

 We rented an apartment across the road from the actual hotel which had all the facilities you would expect but there was no elevator to our top floor apartment 4th floor which was a real pain We had to carry everything that goes along with being out for the day with our 1 and 5 year old up and down the 4 flights of stairs every morning  It was almost next door to Earl s Court train station so it was extremely easy to get around to see all the major sites particularly as we were travelling with a pram as well as a 5 year old not too muck walking ,good

 I didn t know if Id have time for a breakfast on each of the 3 mornings I stayed at the hotel I was informed at check in that Id have to say there and then if I wanted a breakfast for each of the mornings I couldn t just drop down on day 2 for a breakfast and have that charged to my room As it happened I didn t have time for a breakfast on any of the mornings anyway so it didn t matter but I just felt it was a little less accommodating that I have experienced elsewhere However this didn t take from my stay and I would stay again if traveling to London  The location of the Hotel is very good The staff are very friendly and the rooms are lovely and comfortable,good
 They pre authorized one night fee two days before arrival  Excellent location The hotel is located on a very sweet peaceful street and it neighbours to a very lively street with two stations 1 minute walk to Bayswater station 4 minutes to Queensway Station sainsbury tesco starbucks mc donalds pizza hut vodafone three pub lots of restaurants etc So you have easy access to everything The rooms of the hotel are very small but so clean The furniture is new Bathrooms are small but clean and well designed There is a lift available in the hotel The staff are kind and welcoming ,good

 The internet connection was difficult to access The acceptance page did not come up on my tablet Luckily one of the staff knew a trick to make it work type in www google nl That allowed my tablet to access the internet Everyone on staff should know about that option for international travelers who may experience difficulty Also the printer in the lobby did not work for printing out boarding passes  I greatly appreciated the free airport shuttle which I used for both of my visits this month When I had to get a taxi to the airport before the regular shuttle hours started I was surprised that it cost so much to go such a short distance That service represents a real savings The staff was extremely helpful and kind They went out of their way to make me feel at home and answered all my questions cheerfully There was also the option to rent a bike on site which I took advantage of doing I only had an afternoon and evening in Amsterdam so exploring the beautiful countryside magnificent Vondelpark and city center by bike was absolutely a delightful experience ,good

 Only downside was there was obviously some maintenance work going on as scaffolding was being put up from very early every day  The hotel was fab felt quite safe as a solo female traveller Rooms were compact but clean with comfy large beds Also well equipped with hairdryer coffee machine safe etc Staff were all really helpful and friendly would definitely recommend staying at this hotel ,good

 I still recommend this hotel but 2 minor things worth mentioning just for clients to be prepared 1 single blankets only hotel does not have doubles 2 no kettle in the room you need to go downstairs to the restaurant for tea or any other hot beverages very inconvenient during winter stay or when it s cold outside I also had to remind about getting robe and slippers I stayed the in January 2016 and do recommend this hotel for accommodation staff was very welcoming and extremely helpful all the requests were immediately fulfilled breakfasts are good served in the restaurant which belongs to the hotel the room was very warm and comfortable and very clean location is brilliant worth staying and is highly recommended,good
No Negative Good location friendly helpful staff,good
 Could have been a bit warmer in the bedroom but that is more our fault for not asking the staff to increase the room temperature I am sure if we had asked it would have been done This is being nit picky though  The bed and pillows were comfortable The shower had great pressure The staff were helpful and friendly Location suited us perfectly as it was close to a number of metro stations fun bars and restaurants with plenty of happy hour s and the river We would recommend to our friends ,good

No Negative Near to Canary Wharf subway station easy to move around city,good
 The shuttle bus issue we had Although a great service of free shuttle from airport being able to reserve a slot on production of your passport would be something you should think about as people that just exited the airport jumped on bus while we were putting our bags on as we were already first there waiting and then we had to remove our bags and shared a taxi with other people rather than wait another 40 mins for the shuttle to return  The friendliness of the staff comfy beds great city view from our room nice bathroom with great shower Wonderful bar on floor 17 with a rooftop area above I m sure I m the summer months this is a great place to spend time as temperatures were very low these days we stayed The immediate resolvement of the 2 issue we had We needed kettle replacing as the one in room was bit rusty inside replaced immediately although prob shouldn t have been in the room in first place house keeping issue there and gave us complimentary coffees from reception while waiting for kettle to be brought to room Also needed someone to come show us how to work the heater in room Called reception and nice guy came immediately and showed us The free shuttle from airport to hotel also super bonus and the 5 charge for return is good Great savings as would be much more expensive to organise transport ,good

 Room 157 is very noisy There is a service door which cleaners use and where other staff come and go regularly each morning The door bangs very loudly continuously which is very unpleasant Each morning I asked the staff to close the door quietly but without any success  The Urban wing is much better although you will pay more I would return to this hotel as the location is excellent ,good

 It s a fun hotel in a hip part of town but doesn t deserve 5 star rating We ve got the last minute deal via booking com The staff was friendly but we clearly caused a lot of problems They were unaware of the late check out for geniuses offer and obviously weren t taking our word for it it wasn t easy to find on the confirmation email but we managed in the end It was the longest check in process we ve ever had we ve cleared the transatlantic security quicker than that They made a copy of my passport an impression of my credit card the room was already paid for then we were asked to fill in the registration form and again for the the credit card and pin to pre authorise any spending on the card The design is great but then they clearly tried to save on builders everything is is assembled rather cheaply Bits don t necessarily match and there s glue visible between the parts of the design features The lights in a hallway and in in the club bar are flickering There was a 3 inch gap between blackout curtains and the wall next to the head board so you wake up at 7am with bright light shining onto your face whereas the rest of the room is relatively dark  Location design ,good
 far from the train station  Very clean room Nice staff ,good
 ambient facilities around hotel especially the dirt near to subway Staff in front desk is keen to assist the check in also for how to tour the city nearby,good

 Breakfast items were not well stocked up so had to ask for a couple of items and there were no glasses for a little while to have fruit juice in Staff were a bit slow clearing plates bowls etc also had to ask for tea coffee Also I personally don t agree with the automatic 12 5 service charge added to every bill  We apparently got a room upgrade for free Which was a nice touch Really impressed with the security outside and around the hotel All security staff were very polite,good

No Negative Amazing interiors,good
 I needed to work at the desk for several hours When the sun shone directly in it was slightly inconvenient having only Roman blinds which I had to pull fully down rather than vertical or Venetian I found the pillows too high plump However I forgot to ask for others the next day I imagine some could have been found if I had  Excellent breakfast very good choice at the buffet and well cooked Eggs Benedict Unlike in many hotels the shower screen was big enough and well enough fitted to prevent water splashing flooding onto the bathroom floor ,good
 Could hear the next door neighbour snoring at night and cleaners in all surrounding rooms in the morning  Clean spacious and the staff allowed us our freedom around the hotel and in our room ,good
 Unfortunately our room was directly below the gym on the 4th floor so anyone running on the treadmill sounded like they were about to fall through the ceiling  Fantastic location lovely comfortable rooms and helpful staff,good

 I stayed in one of the most basic rooms The bathroom was split between shower and toilet which were very small and had direct access to the room It was perfect for a solo traveler but may have been a concern in terms of privacy if having a companion  I was stuck in Barcelona because of a delayed flight so I had to book something for the same night Room was clean and comfortable The Sci Fi theme carried throughout the hotel made me chuckle the right hint of humor Staff were very polite and helpful The breakfast buffet is pricey but delicious and it has plenty of variety Oh and right on top of Sants train station so awfully convenient if arriving departing from there ,good
 The building work ongoing this was never mentioned or communicated to us which is very disappointing Excellent comfortable room,good
 Staff were not always friendly Great room big and modern,good
 The location is in the business district so everything shuts down early at night We had to walk quite a distance to find a good restaurant and it seemed to be difficult to find locals who were willing to help us with directions  The room has a very trendy and unique look to it and also very comfortable The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to assist us with directions We would definitely book a stay at this hotel again ,good

 Nothing  The location was great close to Paddington easy to find and walkable to Marble Arch and central locations The staff were friendly and the room was super clean and comfortable also quiet and dark We could check in even though we arrived early which was great too Would highly recommend this hotel,good
 The only thing I didn t like was we had no view but that didn t really detract from our stay as the only time we were in our room was night time  The Hotel is in such a good location excellent for the Tate It is such a good hotel with all the room amenties controlled by your in room IPad The staff are really helpful and will help you with anything you need The breakfast was yummy and if you pay for breakfast you get unlimited coffee till 11am The ironing room was a great idea as well as I needed to press my dress so didn t have to ask for an iron just went to the room which are located on every floor I would deffo stay at citizenM next time I visit London would look for a citizenm hotel when I go to other cities ,good

 Location could be better Metro is reasonably close but is not one of the better more convenient lines to be near We more often walked farther to another line Very quiet neighborhood that was largely closed down in August Bed was two twins pushed together and was somewhat uncomfortable especially if we wanted to snuggle  Newly renovated property with powerful air conditioning Quiet roomy and super clean Easy access to our 4th floor room via elevator Rue Cler is an easy walk for good food choices and a market This hotel is a good choice for the traveler who wants American hotel comforts at a reasonable Paris price ,good

No Negative Nice breakfast a bit expensive though Low ceiling in the room and post lighting Will be good for romantic trip too relaxing place for business trip ,good
 Deco of the room is a bit of outdated but I like the bed on top of the shower room as in one room space  Being on top of the hill with this Baroque style is really breathtaking feeling to see the city through bedroom window from restaurant balcony and from public toilet maybe ,good
 breakfast a bit too expensive good location peaceful place,good
 my only criticism would be that the curtains in the rooms do not quite reach the edge so you get a bit of light coming in  This hotel was superb everything was lovely Make sure you get to the cocktail bar ,good
 Couldn t get a booking in the restarant Great location,good
 Unfortunately 1 of our party fell ill just before travelling to the hotel and was unable to make the trip On arrival we asked to cancel her breakfast for the duration of our stay as it would not be needed and we did not want to pay extra for something someone was not going to eat We were told they needed to speak with the manager but the manager was not present We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights and asked every day to cancel the breakfast everyday we got the same response and again the manager was never present On the final day when we were leaving we asked about the cancellation of the breakfast and a refund They told us we should have contacted Bookings com why they could not have told us this at the start of the holiday I do not know They told us they could not give us a refund and that we should have gone through Bookings com If they had told us this when we first asked at the start of the holiday we would have As such I think it would only be fair and property that Bookings com provided us a refund for this breakfast for the 5 days and they can seek compensation from the hotel No Positive,good
 Nada  Nice terrace and all of the necessary amenities Friendly and helpful staff great location close to a number of metro stations and points of interest ,good
 I would not rate this hotel as 4 stars 3 seems more appropriate  Spacious room,good
 Could have been cleaner also a little bit cheaper  The room was beautiful the view is amazing Very modern stylish hotel nice staff ,good
 The only thing I can think of is the low stream in the shower  Where do I start Super friendly staff chic design nice breakfast great location just next to the train station about 5 minutes ride to the city centre We stayed there for 6 nights and can t wait to get back there again Highly highly recommended great atmosphere Also our room had a kitchen so the crew gave us tools to cook and of course the coffee machine that made our mornings nicer ,good
 Nothing we loved everything  Great location about 2 blocks to the Kalverstraat shopping street lots of little shops in the alley with bakeries etc Lots of restaurants in the road behind the property They were so sweet they upgraded us to a suite in the ground floor when I informed them that my mom was using a wheel chair It was very convenient that we didn t need to use the elevators There was free coffee all day and free snacks pastries for afternoon tea Their staff are all very friendly and willing to help with everything It was nice having the canal right in front of the hotel and really feeling Amsterdam We loved the hotel and hope to come back again ,good
 Small room but enough space for two anyway  Good breakfast nice and caring staff room looked exactly like it did on the pictures Stayed with my friend for two nights definitely worth the money and close to both beautiful Camden and club Koko that we loved and the tube station which is just around the corner 15 20mins and you re in central London ,good
 12 noon check out would be better Housekeeping slamming doors Location is excellent Staff very efficient and friendly Great to have complimentary sparkling and stillwater in the room,good
 The room wasn t particularly well sound proofed I was woken by the people in the next room getting in about 3am who proceeded to do what loud drunk people do at 3am  The location is perfect with a couple of tube stations close by and plenty of shops bars ,good
 The housekeeping staff was slow to clean the room one day it didn t get cleaned until after 5 30 in the afternoon  The location could not have been better for us ,good

 None The property is centrally located to many restaurants and attractions Hotel staffs do speak English and are very friendly and helpful We had visited Paris many times in the past and this hotel is the best one The Le Comptoir du Relais restaurant serves delicious food and it is part of the hotel The hotel receptionist can reserve it for you when you stay at this hotel Otherwise there is a long wait line even at 10 pm ,good
 Restaurant closed on Sat Sunday evening Very good value for money first class service from staff,good

 Nothing Absolutely excellent location near the cathedral The free Sunday morning walk around the old town was really great Our room and bathroom were large and excellently equipped ,good
 The rooms was a little cold Good location and friendly staff,good
 In general room and breakfast too expensive for what you get I guess you pay extra for the location Bathroom was very small and room too hot The main problem was the noise We unfortunately had a room with a connecting door Very poor sound isolation through the connection door We could hear every word our neighbors were saying which was particularly annoying since they stayed up until the middle of the night I think this is only a problem in the rooms with connecting doors since we didn t hear any of our other neighbors My advise would be to ask a room without connecting doors  excellent location nice lobby good bed,good
 Nothing i can fault on this hotel Central location right next to Plaza Catalunya easy access to everything Modern and clean hotel room with a shower cladded in marbles to die for prompt service and grand looking Loved and enjoyed the stay thoroughly will definitely stay back at the same hotel the next time we are visiting Metro bus and taxi right on your doorstep,good
 Initial room allocation should have been better sized as a twin room It appeared like a single room being used as a twin  Beds comfy All food consumed in hotel was first class Staff very helpful and attentive Reception staff helped with query regarding disappointingly small room and changed this for us New room was very nice Facilities of the hotel good Nice little gym Lovely quiet area within walking distance to tube and city sights Easy local bus routes at end of road ,good

 The main building of the hotel where the entrance is the breakfast is taken and the majority of the rooms are is not the one shown in the pictures but a relatively new building in the same street The room that we stayed in a superior room was nothing special The decoration was a little bit kitsch plates hanging on the wall kitsch carpet many lamps and the bathroom though renovated seemed quite old fashioned I do not know whether all rooms are the same because to my understanding the hotel is a combination of several buildings As far as the breakfast is concerned I did not like that much the omelettes and the scramble eggs they were not tasty  The breakfast was excellent Great variety of products in a large buffet e g several kind of croissants fresh orange juice several kind of bread cheese and ham eggs and you can also choose from a menu if you want something extra The hotel is situated in the city center and it is close to everything The tv in our room was huge The room was very clean ,good

 N a Lovely hotel rooms very clean and beds amazing Thank you,good
 I had a long stay the room cleanliness could have been more thorough considering I stayed 15 days A bit more than just changing bedsheets and cleaning the bathroom daily More dusting and vacuuming would ve been great  The politeness kindness and efficiency of the staff esp Mr Paulo at the Concierge Location was also great ,good
No Negative Very clean great location for my Canary Wharf office nice big room and very cheap although it was a late deal for a Sunday night,good
 The location is a bit far from subway The service is very good Room is clean and 24 hours gym ,good

 The main hotel staff were lovely but those in the 18th bar were a bit pretentious when we had a quick pre concert drink and it was quiet the lady who served us was lovely but when we returned after the event and it was busy the staff behaved as if we were an inconvenience when you re paying nearly 10 for a beer it shouldn t be too much to ask to have a glass with it  The location was perfect for the O2 and the bed was amazingly comfortable ,good

 The room size was just OK for 2 people Maybe a little bit bigger would be nicer The air conditioning was operating but the room was never warm Finally I consider the hotel a little bit pricey but for London s standards maybe is fair The breakfast for instance wouldn t harm to be cheaper I asked for a room with nice view but I consider that my request was not fulfilled side view 7th floor  The hotel is very quiet and located in a great position The location couldn t be better You exit the hotel and the metro is just around the corner You can walk to the center as well The personnel is very helpful and joyful all the time The room was always clean ,good
 The hotel is tired and the room was not overly clean and a bit shabby This is no longer a five star hotel The staff were excellent,good
 Nothing at all Everythin was more than perfect,good
No Negative Location staff price free printer in the hall to print e tickets ,good
 Not that it s any different but more variety in the mini fridges  I enjoyed being greeted as soon as I opened the entrance door I loved the staircase and enjoyed the shower a lot Comfy bed and clean towels 100 ,good
 The window didn t stayed open  Te bed was really comfy ,good
 N A The value of the money,good
 Rooms a bit tired Friendly staff cleaners were excellent,good
No Negative Comfortable modern and well run ,good
 The room was particularly small with no room to store a suitcase and the air con was not working  Only a couple of minutes walk to Earls Court station and good proximity to bars and several major museums Pleasant and helpful staff Very good restaurant with attractive outdoor area ,good
No Negative Great place,good
 The price for breakfast is almost like that for lunch somewhere in the city  We enjoy really rich assortment of food for breakfast and fast service Location is perfect ,good
 I didn t try the breakfast as it was quite expensive  Location was sensational Room luxurious Staff friendly and helpful Excellent wifi ,good
 The pool was an absolute deception It looks nothing like the pictures and even more so like a pool that you ll find in your local leisure centre but smaller We didn t end up using it despite bringing along our bikinis and planning to do so This wasn t a massive dissapointment though  Room was clean and very modern as was the hotel in general Staff were nice except one lady though I ve spoken to the manager about her already The location is a little far out however there is a bus stop literally 15 seconds outside of the hotel which takes you right to the city centre in less than 20 minutes There is also a metro station only 5 minutes walk from the hotel too For this reason I think the location balances up seeing as the hotel price is very decent Hotel staff helped print out my boarding pass and have a shuttle bus which collects and drops you from to the airport Super bonus ,good
 Bad odor in our room one day but they took care of it right away and I understand that city ventilation systems sometimes have issues that are hard for the property to control  Clean modern facilities in a good location convenient to the metro tourist sights and fun food and nightlife Our room featured a nice view over the city Rooftop bar and pool also with views were a big bonus in the summer although the pool and deck chair area is pretty small and was therefore crowded during peak times The breakfast buffet was yummy and we were happy to catch a free beer tasting one afternoon The staff was very helpful and gave us good recommendations for tapas ,good
 Nothing comes to mind  The hotel is very clean The staff are polite and welcoming Comfy bed ,good
No Negative Convenient ,good
No Negative Easy access to all requirements leisure food squares ,good
 Breakfast is poor Room service,good
 Floors were poor both in and out of room You could hear all conversations from rooms to outside Toilet seat was not in its place pillow case was broaken and staff in it did look really old So deatails and maybe more stable staff now it was new person every time Small room but was ok for me Coffe at breakfast was not good  It is not bad at all everything ordinary Some of staff was even exelent breakfast was included and was ok Location ok Relativly modern good materials used and for example modern toilet shower No aircondition but cooling fan in room I would say nice 3 star in London could use again There was an exelent staff in Saturday morningsift 25 6 that guy was 10 10 ,good
 The heating said We operate a two pipe system cold in Summer hot in Winter When I arrived my bedroom was 25C In order to make it sleepable I needed to turn off the hot pipe heating and leave the window wide open  Staff were brilliant really helpful and friendly but not pushy ,good
No Negative The restaurant is superb ,good
No Negative Everything,good
No Negative Savoy Breakfast,good
 Wasn t given any information regarding meals specifically breakfast which led us to believe breakfast didn t start until 9 on the Saturday so we went elsewhere Found out from another guest that breakfast is served for guests only earlier down stairs It would have been nice to know this from the start of our stay to save us finding somewhere else to eat Even an informtion poster or clearer information in the rooms would help The rooms and locations were excellent,good
 Room was bit small but other wise brilliant Everything was brilliant great location great facilities ,good
 Only downside was the water temperature in the shower could have been a degree or two warmer  Fabulous view location and staff,good
 Would like more places to hang our clothes and towels But his is minor  Great location In the middle of everything and close to subway Free breakfast tastes great ,good
 Wardrobe without door Location is perfect View from the hotel from 17th floor to the Danube River and its surrounding is excellent,good
 Slight musty smell at times presumably due to shower water escaping into spaces between tiles etc  Location cleanliness friendliness of staff,good

No Negative Bed was lovely and comfy,good
 Personally I feel this hotel is over priced I booked this hotel because of a special offer on booking com the price for a deluxe double was reduced from 300 to 167 The price I paid I think was fair for the room but if I d paid 300 I wouldn t have been very impressed It s a nice room but I wouldn t say it was superior to hotels which charge 150 200 a night Especially as that price doesn t even include breakfast Given that it is a tech hotel we would have expected the TV to be better quality The picture was blurry the sound was distorted and buzzy and it was difficult to operate the remote buttons weren t very responsive  The staff here are very helpful and polite Check in was easy and we were offered a complimentary glass of prosecco a nice touch Our room was on the 6th floor a good size with a nice bathroom We liked the tech touches which consisted of 2 tablets by the bed to control curtains and lighting night light desk light bedside light mood lighting etc a tablet by the bathroom to control lights air conditioning underfloor heating bathroom only They also offer a complimentary smartphone with unlimited 4G which you can take out of the hotel and with you for the duration of your trip There was also a Nespresso machine kettle selection of teas and coffee and a minibar although a little empty The bed was super comfy and warm one of the best nights sleep ever We also liked the complimentary bath robes which were soft and cosy and complimentary slippers We walked to the hotel from South Bank to sight see and it took us around 45 minutes at a comfortable pace The location is fairly central you re minutes from Old Street Station ,good

No Negative Clean and cosy hotel friendly staff ,good

 Phone number on the booking confirmation email was not for the correct hotel location it was for a sister hotel located elsewhere so when I called to inquire for the best Underground station to arrive there I was told erroneous information costing me time late at night and 15 Lbs in cab fare On the phone the rep had named the wrong station options and said the hotel was a 3 or 5 min walk When I exited the station Google said 38 min hence the cab When I arrived at Hotel 82 the desk clerk recognized the issue when I mentioned it and was sincerely apologetic saying they really need to get that changed No compensation or upgrade was mentioned though I could tell she was empathetic Other drawback was that two lights did not work the light over the bathroom sink and a ceiling light over one side of the double bed Not sure of the issue but on cable TV only one channel would come through with video My room was in the basement which wasn t a surprise after reading other reviews I wasn t intending to spend much time in the room though working lights and cable would have been a plus I mentioned their pros of helpful staff and good location though I ll prob scan other options next visit  Staff were very helpful Location very good and convenient to Underground stations Oxford St and Marble Arch Free wifi and breakfast though breakfast was nothing special ,good

No Negative Swimming in the pool on the 52nd floor was amazing cocktail bar was great too View from the room were incredible and hotel was so quiet and peaceful for London Welcome tea was a nice touch Wonderfully appointed bathroom bathing while looking out over London was a rare treat and the all singing all dancing toilet added to overall comfort Staff were attentive and efficient without being intrusive and the birthday cake was a lovely gesture ,good
 Photos of hotel entrance were quite dark so I was a bit nervous about my choice but it worked out really well  Old palace with really modern vibe and beautiful design features I loved the garden ,good
 Nothing Excellent property,good
 It was a little bit of a maze to find the room We seemed to be below ground the location Good size room for London ,good
 Breakfast is a buffet so it s never going to be as good as if it were individually freshly prepared  Friendly receptionists and great location to get in and out of the theatre district Also not mainly expensive for a quality hotel ,good
 It will be better when the O2 tunnel is opened properly An electric golf car shuttle round to the river boat station would be good for the less mobile guests  Liz on reception went the extra mile Hotel opened the Market Brasserie an hour early on O2 show night to facilitate preshow eating Very knowledgeable efficient and helpful doorman Marvellous breakfast buffet one of the best I have seen ,good
 The air conditioning could not be turned off All staff helpful and well informed and friendly The bed was the best I have slept in in a hotel ,good

 The Executive suite bar closed st 11pm Staff location room ,good
 we must spare much money in credit card because the hotel take guaranty so much we stayed 2 night with 3 room they took euro 2200 Friendly staff comfort room and nice bathroom,good
 Housekeeping is probably the worst part of the hotel When I checked in my room floor was a mess with biscuit crumbles and teabags on the floor I instantly switched my room 2nd room was clean but housekeeping didn t clean my room the next day They had only made my bed and put my dirty towels that were on the floor onto my bed If they had folded those towels I could be tricked into thinking that they were new clean They didn t clean the bathroom sink or swipe the floor It s also very noisy at night Loud music comes from outside It really doesn t matter which floor your room is or which side it is looking at  Well decorated nice rooms fresh croissants at breakfast friendly staff It is a new and a stylish place I can even open the roomdoor with an app on my phone Awesome ,good
 Lacking of cosyness of the room this room was very business and modern Hotel is too far from the center however woth Public transport this is to overcome in 20 min Metro s trams go every 5 min  Clean openingtimes restaurant bar spa sports facilities Up to date equipment room ,good
 Room not ready at 2pm check in not a problem Arrived back at hotel at 10pm Additional bed not made up had to telephone reception who sent up housekeeping promptly Small grumble otherwise excellent stay No Positive,good
 Unfortunately for a 4 hotel I would expect to have an AC in the room Thanks God I had two fans in the closet the winsows were not blocked AND I stayed NOT during heat wave  Very nice quiet location near Victoria next to the Vincent Park Knowledgeable and nice staff There was a little problem with my TV late at night and the management agreed with no problem to provide breakfast free of charge for this inconvenience Also it was very nice that even that I didn t ask I ve got a free upgrade I booked a one single bed room and got a spacious 2 double beds room with a bathtub It was a treat ,good
 pillows flat personal choice i know Noisy road but to be expected in london  Bed very comfortable good towels tea coffee lovely room overall ,good
 The electricity was off from 2pm to after 10pm on Sunday 2nd August We were notified that it would be off for up to four hours but it was off for over eight hours on our floor There could be more drawer space for those staying longer than a couple of nights Didn t like the washbasin and the bath didn t give you anywhere to place soap etc  The excellent staff and the wonderful breakfasts ,good

 The gate to get out of the underground car park was faulty The button inside didnt work If you can handle the stress of driving in the centre of Milan this is an awesome hotel for your stay  This is our second time staying at this hotel Ideal with underground parking as we were doing a road trip Its a 10 min walk to the centre We had a beautiful junior suite with a spa bath Staff are very helpful ,good
 Restaurant was rather expensive not really value for money and the staff at the restaurant left much to be desired Love the hotel itself the room great value for money and although its not central the nearby underground means this is not really an issue,good
No Negative A great range of options for every palate ,good
 If you have a stroller you need a hand because the entrance has stairs There is no hand shower in the baths so it is a bit difficult to bath your kids  The hotel is very close to the Glocester Road Tube station and 5 minutes walking distance to South Kensington Tube station You can easily walk to National Museum and Science Museum There are plenty of good restaurants near the hotel and hotels own restaurant is also good It has a nice bar for the evenings The rooms are big enough for families The staff is very helpful and friendly There is a free candy bar and lemon strawberry water stand near the entrance ,good
 The toilet hadn t been cleaned there was crust and a hair on the seat The duvet cover had an opening in the corner and the duvet within had big black hairs on it and wasn t very pleasant  Lots of stairs staff didn t hesitate to come running to help carry luggage Made life a bit easier after travelling all day,good

 Very formal staff which can be for some people also advantage  Locality is top,good
No Negative very friendly staff,good
 We booked a wheelchair accessible room and the room we were allocated we could not even get the wheelchair into The concierge realised I think as he showed up with keys to an alternative room This was big enough to accomodate the wheelchair nicely The problem was that the floor in the bathroom was tiled and exceedingly slippy Totally unsuitable for my disabled husband to shower safely and no grab rails I ended up having to put towels on the floor so he could walk to the carpeted area to get dried which was not ideal For accessible rooms these things are essential The lift was also really small and tight to fit a wheelchair and additional person and baggage  The staff in particluar the concierge were excellent Very helpful The restaurant in the hotel was fabulous Bed comfy ,good
No Negative Fantastic location,good
 On fourth floor near train station too much noise No Positive,good
 matts in the tub to prevent slipping would have liked scones jam cream on the breakfast menu staff were excellent room and hotel 100 ,good
 Some of the interior design is a little clunky My room had a wonderful vintage style sink but the tap and plug control were hard to access as they were too large for the unit Also a very old fashioned wall mounted hairdryer as well as being not that effective got in the way a little Small points overall though  This is a charming hotel tucked away in an up and coming section of Paris Great bar scene nearby The interior courtyard is a wonderful surprise oasis surrounded by a number of buildings where the rooms are Some have said the rooms look a little tired but they are very clean and designed to suit the period of the buildings Very comfortable bed which is why you re there Breakfast was good if a little hard to find at first ,good
No Negative Staff were very helpful,good
 The shower was really bad no power at all The room was tiny I ve stayed here many times before and this was the smallest room I ve had  Location is perfect for my needs Beds very comfy as always Welcoming staff and when I d forgotten my earrings they kept them aside for me Love they have a 12 00 p m checkout Many hotels are changing it to 11 00 a m ,good

 Booking in process was unusually complex and obscure for some reason had to pay 50 euros extra in advance in case we used the minibar During my stay I had a brief question to ask at reception but unfortunately had to wait behind a couple booking in and that is a marathon process why The beds were comfortable but the duvet was a bit too hot  Breakfast was A1 Lovely room we were upgraded don t ask why because I don t know but we had a very spacious and comfortable room with a gorgeous bathroom Good atmosphere and friendly staff ,good

 Little noisy Every morning room keepers knocking at your door although they could coordinate this with reception they ask to leave the key when you leave So don t expect non disturbed long sleep in the morning Shelf for clothes is so tiny that you can t fit a normal size coat in it Actually dont understand the function of this size shelf at all to be honest Night time reception man speaks English very bad and is VERY slow Prepare for that Look for space on the street for parking and pay 5EUR till 11AM instead of 20EUR night parking at the parking they offer 200 meters away  Nice location but there was a construction on the site which was starting their loud work at 9AM or earlier Good breakfast though could be a more cozy room for having it Very nice and helpful lady in breakfast room ,good

 The weather could have been better It was a bit cold with light rain but nothing stopped us from wandering the streets day or night  We loved the location Close to the canals Dam square good dining and cute cafes as well as being within walking distance from many important museums The hotel is small enough so you don t get lost yet big enough to serve your traveling needs Nice relaxing bar really nice breakfast area and comfortable rooms and general feel The staff was super helpful and the locals were ready to point us in the right direction when we got off the correct street or walkway We felt safe and secure as we sought out the treasures of Amsterdam The Mecure Hotel Amsterdam is a really nice affordable hotel in a really nice city ,good

No Negative Location facilities and very friendly staff,good
 Not the most modern hotel  Convenient location and terrific prices available,good
 The fact that when you put a Debit Card down on the room in case you have anything from the mini bar etc that they insist on taking 100 out of the account then will refund it when you leave Did not like that the Standard rooms did not have a bath when the price was 188 you would expect this Very stylish modern and the staff were extremely helpful Loved that they looked after our luggage the day we booked out for the whole day even though our stay was over,good

No Negative Location,good
  Technology design courtesy,good
 Comparing to our first stay it seemed the staff was overwhelmed with corporate meetings and large tour groups that distracted from blue chip service Example it took four requests to get a coffee refilled at breakfast It took two requests to get a newspaper delivered I don t remember either of these simple requests being an issue when we stayed there last year  Front desk personnel were exceedingly helpful Hotel is beautiful in a quirky way and perfectly situated for all the things we wanted to do we walked everywhere It was our second visit we were so taken with the place last year Especially liked the assortment at breakfast and after dinner desserts in the bar We stayed in the new back building this year our room was more spacious and better laid out than what I recall ,good
No Negative The staff were so lovely friendly and very helpful and informative We liked that we were offered coffee and croissants on our arrival at check in and told that the hotel was our home for the weekend The jazz in the evenings was fabulous and the courtyard was a great bonus to be able to sit outside by still be warm in Winter ,good

 Water leaking to the room when taking shower The bathroom of standard double room black tile with bathtub was a nightmare First the bathtub is too high for petite people Then the wet and dry separation didn t worked at all The glass door seal of the tub is aging which would let water leak to the floor And there s no floor drain So the water kept leaking to our room and finally soaked the carpet We stayed for just two nights so we didn t ask for changing a room I just can t understand why does a great 4 star hotel make such a stupid design like this  Location is great Breakfast and dinner are quite good additional beverages are over priced Staffs are friendly And room is modern styled and clean Actually I m satisfied with everything except for the bathroom ,good
 a group with 3 4 different reservations meant we had to wait a while to check in as only 1 member of staff on the desk the Bar staff were very quick to close up even though we would have stayed up and ordered more after 11pm bed was comfortable liked the toiletries etc provided in bathroom such as spare toothbrush and razor Brilliant size of room and ideally located a short walk from both gloucester road and earls court tube stations Price seems about average for London especially when I realised there were a lot of people in town due to national football game,good

 Didnt expect so few space in the room The biggest disappointment was Wi Fi You have 2 types of room with and without Wi Fi We got the one with Wi Fi For every 24h you had to insert username and password to use it which was happening frequently because sometimes it logs you off Nevermind that the wi fi was very bad low signal and very low speed for a room with wi fi Jesus  Bed was good for sleeping its location is very good Mariahilfe street is very near and public transport is very accesible Staff is pleasant ,good

 There was no BBC news channel other than French spoken channel We reported to the staff that told us the engineer had checked our room We couldn t get BBC channel in our room because the location of our room The staff didn t think an alternative way to solve the problem which I found slightly disappointed I do stay in the Paris for holiday watching TV isn t a big issue however I do like to know what s going on in the world early in the morning before I get out of the door Especially all the disasters have happened in Paris recently I do recommend the hotel to solve the TV problem out for foreign travellers  The location is brilliant ,neutral
 I paid for a river view which I did not get due to heating not working in room my view ended up being scaffolding Waiting for another room made our whole evening late We missed our anniversary dinner in town Ended up having room services which we had to wait over an hour for Not the great anniversary gift I had planned for us I still feel really upset and disappointed  Friendly staff ,neutral

 I hated the bathroom Taking a shower was so hard the room was so tiny we couldn t fit despite it wasnt the smallest room Staff was not very welcoming  Location close to subway station,neutral
 I found that the hotel s service and ambience had gone down due to no doubt the ongoing building work I found the noise of the building work that started at 8 00 to be somewhat irritating nothing like the noise of a drill and hammering to start the day off well and breakfast took a very long time to arrive However when I complained they did take the service charge off the breakfast cost I will go again and hopefully the building work will have finished  I have stayed here a number of times as it is a good location and the staff are usually efficient,neutral

 The hotel is only as good as the staff running it and the experience was terrible At a considerable cost and many complaints I would not recommend this hotel to anyone I have complained to the management and been offered a meal to compensate as they cannot turn the clocks back This was the third and final visit After such a disappointing stay and response from management and a very expensive ruined week end I can only hope that my review will deter others from experiencing similar situations  The rooms in the hotel are excellent as is the view That s it there is no 5 service ,neutral
 I dislike that the hotel charged me one night of hotel on my credit card even though I stated I prefer to pay by cash Even though they did a refund for me I still lost some money due to exchange rate Also it is true I read somewhere that there s smell of drain but this can be resolved by just closing bathroom door all times and keep aircon running  Cute looking room decent location ,neutral

 Got what I thought was a special offer price that seemed more like a price for substandard experience Hard to find the room corridors like a Warren with paper signs that were worn and grubby No porter and a dismissive point from the concierge to get a trolley ourselves Once maneuvered onto correct floor had to get two very heavy cases and two smaller up 6 stairs then get them through the maze of corridors that were semi blocked with maids trolleys The hotel felt more like a hostel with crowds of youngsters congregating in the lobby for coaches then in the evening slouched over the sofas some asleep Every morning we were woken early by loud shouting down the corridors from what appeared to possibly be construction workers Most awful hotel experience I ve ever had which constrasted greatly with that when this hotel first opened Staff were also unwelcoming Would never stay there again  Good location for my needs ,neutral

 The room was utterly hot and the air was amazingly dry We tried to tweak the airco system but it didn t improve anything We then even called reception to send someone up to help us amend the climate of the room The guy who showed up to help mentioned that we shouldn t turn the AC high because since it was still on winter setting it would only make the room hotter which sounded weird to us but ok we tried After turning it off the temperature didn t seem to move eitiher We could slightly open the window but that didn t help either So in the end we woke up soaking wet of sweat and with a headache that didn t leave us till the end of the day For a hotel that is far from cheap one would expect more comfort on something relatively easy as regulating the climate Big miss  Located in a nice part of town also decent and clean facilities,neutral

 Let s face it it was not a five star hotel The rooms were small bathrooms shabby The first room we stayed in was extremely noisy even after i switched off the air conditioning The dirty window was facing the wall In the second room the tv set was not working properly After several request is was fixed though For the same value one can get a decent 4 star hotel which will be both better located and nicer  The staff was nice They gave me a birthday card and cupcakes when they find out i have a birthday To change a noisy room for a quiet one was also not a problem as well as fixing the tv set and the remote control ,neutral

 Tiny rooms Expensive Need complete refurbishment  Good location,neutral
 Tiny room not worth the money and not a 4 standard room Couldn t hang clothes in the wardrobe because the ironing board was inside and blocking the rail Room too small to put the ironing board if I took it out Room was in the Basement very noisy Window looked out onto the corridor meaning the curtains had to be kept drawn at all times Dark room lights need to be on at all times Very disappointing overall  Excellent location Clean overall,neutral
 The Asian staff in reception in the morning is quite nice but the one who is in charge of the reception in the night is bad both in facial expression and attitude We only have a luggage But the moment he saw the luggage he gave us a obvious white eye and started to murmured about his backache We even not asked for any help If this is the attitude goes with a so call 4star hotel I think the full score must be ten star  Room is clean ,neutral

 There is nothing particularly special about this hotel and if you are looking for any kind of charm then this is not the one to choose If we had paid the full price which is in excess of 400 then we would have been very disappointed The breakfast is rather poor I think the coffee was instant and is served in a very dark basement room We would have been better off going to one of the nearby lively and bright caf s  All of that being said it is friendly comfortable very well located and quiet despite being in the centre of a bustling city ,neutral
 There is no tea or coffee in the room Great location varity breakfast,neutral
 The room we were allocated was in the basement and definitely not the room in the picture when we booked It had only one window which was up fairly high and the school behind played football every night until about 7 30 pm and quite often the ball would hit the window At the very least there should be a security grill or something over the window so that the balls from the school do not hit the window The bathroom left more than a little to be desired as the water from the shower would leak through the gap in the glass partition and end up on the floor where we had to use hand towels to mop it up Also the T V reception was quite poor and we only could get a couple of channels We also asked for room service one night and were told that we would have to go across the road to your sister hotel and get our own room service If we had realized we were going to be in a 2 star accommodation hotel we would have booked elsewhere  The only good things about our stay was the Continental breakfast each morning was really good with a nice variety of cereals and fruit and the flaky croissants were just beautiful The proximity to the restaurants coffee shops and entertainment was the best and was the saving grace of our stay Lara on reception was a god send and helped us every day and Elena the waitress at breakfast was also most helpful and always had a smile on her face ,neutral

 Room very small musty smell in corridor outside our room Some toiletries not replaced each day No Positive,neutral
 Check in was quite poor I modified my booking via Bookings com at least 3 months prior to arrival however the hotel had no record of these changes This is the second time that I have stayed at the Pillar Hotel and the reception staff tried to indicate that the previous booking from 2014 was the same as the 2016 booking which wasn t even in the same name It took far too long for reception to sort out whatever needed to be sorted out at their end before providing the room key Also as with the previous booking we had to ask to change rooms after only a few days The rooms don t appear to be maintained as expected as the bathroom tiles were cracked and the floor moved thus creating a health problem as you could not step out of the shower with bare feet We were offered the room next door which had the same issue although to a lesser extent The room that we moved to did not have a working safe and maintenance was not available until the next day Every morning we had to call reception for amenities whether it be towels toilet paper tissues etc as housekeeping didn t replace these as expected Also every day the shower mat was placed inside the wet shower making it sopping wet and unusable There was no business centre with a computer and printing facility that could be used by guests and the staff were very inquisitive as to why such services were needed which frankly is none of their business They tried to assist in locating an internet cafe but where they sent me did not exist As one of the few decent hotels in the area it would be expected that a corner of the hotel should be converted into a business centre to allow guests to have access to necessary services that cannot be accessed via tablets  There was plenty of parking on site Location is easily accessible via road and public transport ,neutral

 My son and his partner were competing in the London Marathon and requested an early breakfast but the staff said they could not supply it before 7 30 We have stayed in hotels in London before and they have promoted an early Marathon breakfast This spoilt our whole stay as we had to dash out to local supermarket and buy yogurts serial etc for them to fuel up Perhaps you could think again before another year there are 40 000 people competing in this event  Good powerful shower nice to have a fridge in the room ,neutral
 The quality of the rooms and items in the room were of a cheap standard Our shower had mould all around the floor tiles and the water pressure was non existent The bed sheets were like cardboard and pillows were rock hard In order to reach the toilet paper one had to get up off the toilet and reach across the other side of the room as this was its location Even the tallest of people would still have to do this The hotel price is very high and the quality is that of a 3 star hotel We were supposed to stay for two nights but left and went to a 4 star hotel close by that was excellent Hotel Manzoni Again the staff were great but unfortunately the quality of the rooms was very disappointing  The staff were very helpful and did everything to make us feel welcome and at home They also went beyond with a birthday gift for my partner waiting in our room for when we returned Location is also very very good,neutral

 Everything sadly this hotel trades on its location and photographs I ve stayed in much better bed and breakfasts I can only assume the star rating is self appointed No one answered the phone when i called prior to arrival to ask about parking of which there is none When we did arrive the receptionist was so devoid of human emotion I assumed he was a badly automated robot The first room had a Chinese water torture device constantly dripping gurgling AC unit fitted as an unwelcome addition The second room lacked basics like tea coffee a kettle etc The position of our Executive Room was in the basement next to the kitchen so we were woken at 8am on a Sunday by the chef juggling the crockery Breakfast was a joke Having paid extra for an inclusive breakfast we were told we only qualified for the Continental Breakfast which was a basket of luke warm limp bread optimistically described as toast and a cafetiere filled with dishwater equally optimistically described as coffee Anything beyond that including cereals was additional The service at breakfast was appalling I was unsure at which point Beadle was going to jump out and let me in on the gag Its a beautiful building but as a hotel its trading on its South Ken credentials very hard any where else it would struggle  Location was ideal for the purpose of our stay in London Large room for London and very comfortable huge bed ,neutral

 This hotel has Aeropuerto in its name therefore mostly geared towards passengers arriving from a flight departing next morning or both Their airport shuttle should be the most important offering Instead if you book a stay at this hotel there is no guarantee you re getting a shuttle ride at all They run the shuttle from the hotel to the airport on a preset schedule with 45 minute intervals and there are only 8 seats per ride I would strongly suggest taking this into consideration before booking this hotel as this may screw up your plans very badly The hotel itself is in a middle of a industrial area not sure if you can get a taxi to pick you up from there Our reservation was breakfast included we came in and sat at a table The breakfast attendant asked us the room number which we thought was normal At the end without any explanation she handed us a bill for our breakfast which apparently we must pay now I pulled my smartphone showing our reservation on Booking com clearly stating that breakfast was included Instead she sent us to the receptionist to handle the bill situation At first the receptionist tried to convince me that breakfast was not included until I pulled my smartphone again then she clicked something on her computer and said it was ok and we did not have to pay for breakfast Breakfast area was not air conditioned hot and muggy the food choice was minimal and of poor quality Their only coffee machine was a hit or miss Had to complain it did not dispense hot water attendant came in and restarted the machine If you pressed Hot Chocolate you got Coffee If you re planning to use the indoor pool please remember that they require everyone to wear a swim cap  Very spacious two bedroom suite with the largest bathroom had a Jacuzzi shaped bathtub Very comfortable mattresses ,neutral

 We were very disappointed by the hotel bar and its staff We returned to the hotel at 11 15 on Saturday evening to have a drink in the hotel bar We were told at this time that it was last orders When booking the hotel we noted that the bar was open until 1a m on their website When we asked reception they told us that the bar was operated separately and sometimes closed early when it was quiet They must have turned 20 people away and refused to serve people a second drink We only got a second one when we complained This was extremely disappointing to us  The hotel was lovely good location very nice concierge welcoming you to the hotel Nice decor,neutral

 When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist was a bit too friendly and asked my boyfriend to carry the bags in the room by himself which is very bad We are a young couple however we re used to attend 5 hotels and this never happened anywhere else before I think this should not happen as it s a minimum service to carry the luggage and show us the room When we arrived in the room we where suprised because there was a wall right in front of our window with a man smoking his cigarette and looking at us No intimicy Of course we asked to change the room immediatly and we were offered another room which was fine According to me the staff should anticipate more the client s needs especially if you pretend to be a 5 hotel In addition the rooms are not isolated which means that you litterally hear the other clients flushing the toilet  We liked the design of the Hotel in general and of course the pool However it s smaller than on the pics and not heated which is a no go for a 5 hotel with rooftop pool ,neutral

 The decor is very tired wallpaper curling away from the walls at the corners very faded carpets across the hotel multiple chips and blemishes in the bathroom windows in the bar area have possibly never been cleaned It looks like it would have been a beautiful hotel when it was last refurbished but that very likely wasn t this century The room was very noisy from approx 6am until 1am due to the DLR and the fact a window in the room was broken open and I wear hearing aids so may be intolerable for a normal hearing person The plumbing was dangerous due to the temperature of the shower consistently veering from stone cold to scalding hot causing my partner to get burnt I found the beds to be very firm which isn t to my liking but may be to your liking Reception staff weren t interested in my attempts to point out the broken items in the room and the duty manager fobbed me off by saying to just email them instead It was very difficult to get my booking amended and resulted in over 45mins on the phone using a premium priced phone line being passed back and forth between departments My free upgrade was a nice surprise and the view over Canary Wharf was lovely Cheap compared to other hotels in the area Breakfast was comprehensive and mostly delicious ,neutral

 This is not a 5 star hotel anymore We already stayed there a couple of times But this stay did not meet our expectations Breakfast is mediocre but allright We wanted a nice and relaxing Sunday brunch until 12 which is a bonus But at 10 30 they in particular a busy manager started taking away tables and seats in one of the two rooms for a lunch buffet until it was empty They only waited that we would finally leave after having been there for 15 minutes After having changed the room we noted that also the nice tea bar was gone and had been replaced by a champagne bar for the lunch The small spa is not very clean Wet towels left by guests everywhere dirty glasses empty soap dispensers no tea water mould in the steam room broken fittings After two days we did not use the spa anymore The first days the bar was used for a convention and rearranged with additional functional furniture it came along with a heavy smell of food On one evening it was even closed for some time On the last day the room service came late but the breakfast was abbondant Too many inconveniences and negative points for 5 stars and the room price of more than 200 Euro without breakfast which is 29 It is a pity but we have to look elsewhere  Very good location Friendly staff at the reception ,neutral

 First of it is not a 5 stars hotel How can one man name hotel Casual luxury Casual is casual luxury is luxury Please just check inside the lobby the decoration window with falling leaves etc This is antidesign I would be embarrassed to put something like this in 5 stars hotel Even in Chinese bistro the decoration looks much more tasteful Horrible Ridiculous Every time I was discovering some adstances of cleaning in the room 504 So first I found the rest of my apple which I droped there 2 days ago and it wasn t removed Second the cleaning lady was always forgetting cleaning sponge or fabric on the table Wifi was like a natural disasters never worked Every time I should login because server could not recognized my device And most of the people were business people in hotel So I spent time again and again to login Of course you can have better wifi but for much money Everywhere in the world even in third world countries wifi is for free Breakfast was just bad like at the countryside train station somewhere in Romania Directors of hotel please do not cheat on us If hotel named 5 stars behave like 5 start and do order same cook for breakfast and dinner for morning and evening  The only friendly and professional person in this hotel is David from the restaurant He is really great person open mind cheerful delightful and without prejudice Bravo and thank you for your outstanding service Kitchen in the evening is very good but not for breakfast ,neutral

 First of all the hotel charges us TWO times for the hotel Currently trying to get our money back the bed was really uncomfortable and felt really old and the lighting in the bathroom was really poor Will probably not visit this hotel again  The staff was nice and helpful during our stay it was fairly close to the underground and it was easy to get a taxi from outside the hotel The food in the hotel s restaurant was good The breakfast was decent The restaurant and the lounge area was modern and up to date ,neutral
 I don t normally provide feedback however this hotel is terrible The walls are paper thin you can hear the people in the bathroom going about their business in the room above walking around with squeaking floorboards hear people walking around the halls The ceiling height is incredibly low making you feel like you are in a cave The free wifi is predominantly slow or doesn t work at all The shower is ridiculously small and pressure variable at best The hairdryer may as well have been one of the staff members blowing hot air out of their mouths There is no services welcome manual in the room The decor is pretty much dressing mutton up as lamb I don t recommend it would steer clear I paid half the price at an IBIS and although small you got what you paid for PLUS high speed internet friendly staff free breakfast and a comfortable bed  The location,neutral
 The room had no curtains and when reported they were aware of it but hadn t sorted it Many complaints and requests to speak to the manager were met with being told to please be patient I had to make some curtains out of a towel bed throw and coat hangers 100 a night for a room that makes Harry Potters cupboard under the stairs look palatial and to bring your own curtains value for money I think not I was informed the manager would contact my by Saturday afternoon 3 days later I m still waiting Some of the staff were rude and almost put out by my complaint a shrug of the shoulders and a sorry is not an acceptable way to treat paying guests This hotel has the potential to be a good one a shake up of staff and some lessons in hospitality and the rooms having the basics should help with that Do not be swayed by the photographs Photoshop has be put to good use here  Good location to the tube ,neutral

 The rooms were extremel noisy the cleaners were talking very loud from early in the morning and the cleaning equipment was handled very noisily Everything that was going on the corridors was loudly heard in the rooms We asked the staff to be quiet but the next day I woke for a loud talking again at 7 am by the staff The hotel is not suitable if you need a rest The last night a drunk guest was making rumours so from the 6 nights there was only 1 2 that we could sleep properly  The room was cleaned every day The location is great few steps from the metro station and very close to sights and the downtown ,neutral
 The picture you advertise next to the price of the room you think you are booking isn t what you actually get False advertising Thinking you are going to get a beautifully furnished room but what you actually get is a step up from a travel lodge The marbel bathroom was more luxurious than the room itself What a disappointing 1 year wedding anniversary stay So much so we considered travelling the 4 hours in the direction we had just come Most upsetting No Positive,neutral

 The hotel was quite dated and the family room we were given was very basic The heating in the room did not work so for 3 nights we were literally frozen No attempt made to rectify the matter or be given an alternative room We did complain but no response as of it received from the management The hotel was very pricy for the facilities it had The lift was slow and often took the stairs as it was quicker The restaurant was very average and basic with not a great selection on offer The reception staff were friendly but not great decision makers  The location was fine ,neutral

 Extreme lack of lightly in areas painted completely black Very dangerous Classic example of trendy design over basic function Trendy certainly user friendly not really Lack of adequate computer and printing facilities Having to balance a small chained up laptop on ones knee while hunched on a small stool is hardly appropriate for serious computer access This precluded completion of some important work related tasks Corridors and stairwells dark which would create significant problems for persons with disabilities or poor eyesight  Location breakfast and concierge,neutral

 The mini bar is computerised and stuffed full so if you move anything to put something of your own in to keep cool your bill is going to grow rapidly although if you notice the staff are happy to sort for you Unfortunately the computer system was down on checking out and still 28 hours later still not received any promised invoice or bill  The location for the O2 is perfect and removes any stress,neutral
 We had a 2 room reservation One of the rooms was very small and requested for that room to be changed The staff went out of their way not to accomodate us on a different room First they claimed not to have a room available then that they did but had to wait hours to be changed but we had to leave the room immediately Finally they wanted to charge 15 euros because the coffe machine had been used Manager Janine Zooties stated that she did not care about me complaining because all complaints went to her She refused to give me her last name and said that it was a very difficult name I would not recommend this hotel I do travel a lot and would not return to this hotel No Positive,neutral

 Booking com scammed me out of what I thought I had booked the property for and what I was charged upon arrival Will NEVER use them again I had also put in for 3 adults and when I got to the hotel they said it was only booked for 2 and charged me 15lbs more a night for my daughter The customer service person dealing with my issue was not sympathetic and did not offer any consolation like even a free drink As far as the actual hotel the lighting scheme in the room with the buttons took time to learn There was plenty of room for a table and a chair or two to eat at but there was none there There were no drawers to unload our clothes into just a few hangers and a rod The bed was hard as a rock and we asked for an additional down comforter to put under us  The bar area was nice to congregate at The closeness to the sites of Westminster and the Westminster or Waterloo underground stations was convenient The outdoor staff was wonderful about getting you a taxi and unloading and reloading bags ,neutral

 The full booking room rate for our 3 night stay was taken out of our credit card prior to arrival which was disappointing as I booked through my Australian credit card but intended to pay in pounds The room was tiny and in the basement The bed was against the wall so access for two people was very inconvenient One staff member never bothered to even look up to acknowledge us on arrival or departure which appeared very rude and gave us security concerns as anyone could walk in unchallenged  Location to Earls Cout Station and shops and restaurants is excellent The room was clean and the bed was comfortable,neutral

 We went away for my birthday week as we wanted to get away for some peace and quiet away from building work near our home We weren t informed that major work was currently going on in the hotel So obviously not happy with the sound of loud drilling and a lot of noise during our stay including heavy items being hurled into a skip right outside our room early in the morning Our bed was Itchy and uncomfortable We woke up with bites and itching all over We certainly wouldn t expect this from a Marriott It was very frustrating not being able to get through to the correct staff on the telephone I must of phoned fifteen times to chase up the problem I either got cut off or told somebody would call me back which they didn t Our bathroom smelled old and bad As a Marriotts rewards member We stay in Marriotts all over the country often through booking com up until now we have never felt physically sick due to the thought of bed bugs in any of them We were moved to an alternative room on our third night but it s just not acceptable that i spent my birthday week awake two nights running because of the quality of the bed then to be woken with the sound of building work in the mornings Only last week I stayed at a Marriott in Birmingham and it was a perfect stay This Marriott in Regents Park certainly Wasn t the same  Nice lobby and bar also pool nice The food excellent ,neutral

 Hotels lovely on arrival staff our friendly can t doubt first impressions On check in the receptionist asked for my card to secure the booking I asked her if this meant payment would be taken she said no I just need the card information to secure the booking I said okay cause I want to pay on another card at the end of my stay As the day went on I went to withdraw some cash from the cash point where my card got declined I went into the bank and they said a payment had been frozen of 206 10 from the grange white hall hotel which happend to be how much I had transfer d from another account for spending money in London I returned back to the hotel to discuss why they didn t make it clear to me that they would be holding a balance of 206 10 in my bank account as now I have no money for the weekend as they have held my money in which I got a muffled response by the receptionist who did it the only outcome I got was that they wouldn t be able to unfreeze it until the end of my stay in which then it will be taken as payment to the hotel so Instead of letting it ruin my stay considering I had only just arrived luckily I had money in another account that I could move over to use for the weekend annoying but what can you do I wasn t getting anywhere just stressed Anyway after a brilliant weekend in London exploring it s amazing sites it s check out day The same receptionist as check in is on the desk so I thought great atleast she knows what happend with my payments etc She asks how our stay was which I couldn t complain about anything it was great The rooms were lovely and comfortable beds the location was excellent she then asks for my card in which I questioned why she needed it again in which she said to authorise the held money in my account to make it as a payment I said so the money you ve held on check in will be released to you as payment now she said yes yes that s right  The comfort of the room and location ,neutral

No Negative The wifi was appallingly slow in the room and non existent on the roof top bar The bathroom in our Superior room was tiny and very poorly designed with few toiletries one shampoo that doubled as shower gel no conditioner no bathrobes and the basin was in the corridor outside the bathroom so no possibility of any privacy and no space around it for two people s toiletries the shower was in the same tiny space as the loo so we swapped rooms with my daughter whose Standard room had a better bathroom but was a smaller size with a smaller bed For two people sharing the Superior room the bathroom is a joke not a funny one Breakfast was chaotic with the main coffee machine broken throughout our four night stay A tiny kettle provided to boil water for tea but it was the slowest you could ever imagine and also tiny so one was constantly looking for staff to ask for more water Not enough teapots ever large cups ran out no plain yoghurt on two days the most popular so there were always spare fruit ones that no one seemed to want choice of food was good though some cakes and pastries tasted of chemicals and were clearly not home made Very dry and tasteless Red Velvet cake Check out was problematic Summary brilliant location clean hotel nice staff but terrible bathrooms and chaos at breakfast Needs a shake up in management at breakfast which incidentally was NOT included in the price and charges hefty 9 Euros per person if booked for the duration of your stay at check in otherwise I think it was 15 Euros per person and a rethink about everything to do with the bathrooms which were just dismal ,neutral
 The room was very small indeed Also the maid did not clean the bath on the second day  The staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast is excellent ,neutral
 Booked and paid for a delux room with a view of the Duomo however upon arrival the receptionist confirmed that a standard room was booked and as a favour she gave an upgrade free of charge to executive The so called upgrade was a tiny dark smelly pungent cigarette smell room with an internal view of construction site We had to insist on a room change which was subsequently provided The new room was very good modern clean with a view of Duomo Poor selection and variety of dishes at breakfast the items available were rather tasteless  Nice room Comfortable bed Clean,neutral
 The room was very small for 540 a nightNo Positive,neutral
 Poor attitude of staff was very disappointing They were very unhelpful when they made a mistake with our parties booking and we found someone else in our room At first they refused to give us a different room as they said they were fully booked After complaining to the hotel manager and the company we booked with they miraculously found a room available for us It s a nice place to stay but I wouldn t say it s 4 star 3 at best Good location in very close proximity to Barcelone el Prat Airport and a 2 minute walk to the metro and local facilities such as a bank hospital supermarket and all purpose store Very clean rooms and good housekeeping,neutral

 I would never have booked this hotel if I had known they were going to give me a room sad excuse for a room in the basement next to the breakfast area lots of noise Luckily I got another room for the second and third night The hotel was very noisy at all times as if the staff just did not want you to sleep because they wanted to start cleaning the rooms Poor quality rooms falling apart Expensive for what it was Not coming back No Positive,neutral

 It s somewhat unbelievable that the hotel doesn t keep any irons in the entire facility To me that is simply outdated The shower area is strangely designed There s no possibility of keeping the foot towel close to the door which leads to water spillage in the bath room It s a simple issue of designing the door or the floor in a way that allows close contact between the towel and the door thereby absorbing the water from the shower  Great connectivity by train proximity to the train station Of course the staff was friendly and generally very courteous ,neutral

 The bar staff have major trust issues Aproaching the bar to order a drink I was stopped and told no need to go the bar as my order would be taken at my table Myself and my wife were then asked several times while sitting having the said drinks that we need to pay for them I asked if there was a problem and was told that I would be surprised how many people don t pay and walk out This was on the first night of a 4 night stay that cost 1250 I was hardly going to take off for the sake of one round of drinks after paying the hotel fee upfront At check out today while waiting of our taxi to the train station we were also told to leave the bar as my two children were eating a sandwich that was bought in as they had a restaurant below the bar area when I said we were only waiting of a taxi the barmaid waitress was unmoved and adamant that my children must go outside to eat there sandwich or order from the menu Thanks for that Very untrusting suspicious staff that need a lesson in manners and also need to realise that they have left a lasting impression Hotel was very good and the cleaning staff were friendly and helpful the hotel management would do well to reverse the roles of bar staff cleaners A shame that the lasting impression of this hotel was the bad experience of the bar lounge staff I won t be using this hotel again only because I felt I was looking over my shoulder all the time and was uncomfortable all the time while in the bar If your wanting a relaxing time my advice is to ignore the waitresses and pay up front at the bar Also plan your escape a bit better than I did as in don t try and fill any time away from this hotel on the day of checkout and return as your not very welcome once you have checked out  Very clean and a great location Desk staff very good,neutral

 The room was small which was the least of our worries The shower kept going hot and cold which was annoying The stairwell lights were out which considering it was a narrow spiral staircase was not good The first time in over 50 years of travel paper cups were provided in our room and we got one tea bag in our room on the first day of our stay no more were provided When we arrived for breakfast on the 3rd and 4th days at 8 30am there was no muesli no croissants all the white cheese had gone so had most of the meat When we spoke to the person looking after the breakfast the approach was so what the girl on the desk however arranged for someone to go out and get some croissants The piece de resistance however occurred on our last night We watched the Rio olympics until after 11 and then couldn t turn off the tv The batteries in the control had corroded I replaced them but the terminals had gone There was no switch on the tv so I had to remove the tv from the wall to get at the wall switch The real issue was that all the problems were avoidable with a little care and planning  This bed was comfortable and the air conditioning went well ,neutral
 Lack of cleanliness Shower tiles had mould Basin didn t drain properly  Location,neutral
 When we asked for two single beds we were given a double bed with two single mattresses not what we wanted I had to really insist and they managed to find a room with two separated barely single beds These beds were soooooooo narrow that I rolled out twice Seriously I should also add that we are a single couple one with his arm in a cast and they gave us a room as far from the elevators as possible We did not sleep well for 5 nights  Room was perfectly clean and attractive Several staff members except for the one who checked us in were warm and friendly ,neutral

 Room was too small My partner had to climb over me to get out of bed We kept bagging our legs on the leg of the bed No hot water in shower Only tepid water came out of the shower head and even then it trickled out so we couldn t shower On cold the pressure was fine The knob on the shower was broken For a 4 star hotel to have such a small room and with no hot water in the shower is shocking value for money  Position of hotel,neutral

 Walked in room and curtains had fallen down They sent someone straight away to fix it but wasn t offered alternative room or anything Rooms very hard to find with different lifts and block layout Felt v much like converted 60s council flats Got a deal for 100 but definitely wouldn t pay top rate for it River bus useful but Canary Wharf station much further walk than indicated on site at least 15 20 mins Bar and restaurant quite upmarket room service extortionate with plate charge DoubleTree brand much better in other locations Leeds is beautiful  Car service brill much cheaper than taxis Super comfy bed and very quiet room with balcony and river view Bargain if you can get a room for around 100 ,neutral
 Well first of all the room we booked is nothing like the photo we see on internet And the facilities are not exactly fits on description lack of things The most annoying part is the staff in reception who is not helpful at all we waste lots of time to do the things which the reception should tell us before to be more efficient  Parking,neutral

 My booking is a buiseness room but the services are way below this level The extremely bad cleaning and housekeeping I can tell syiries about that The primitive old uncomfortable furniture The old unclean appliances iron ironing table and coffee machine Housekeeping coming to disturb despite the do not disturb sign Old bed linnens and towels This place needs complete refurbishing proper housekeeping and dining services if they want to keep their five stars  Near to Champs Elysees,neutral

 Toilet blocked and room too hot even though the air con was on  Staff were friendly and helpful,neutral
 Staying there last we were unpleasantly surprised by the several things value for money The quality of rooms is way below the price Rooms need renovation they are shabby some places wall paper comes off the walls doors look like from 10 years ago we had to pay extra 39 for our sons bed even though in the past it was never the case  We ve been staying in this hotel for last year stayed first time about a year ago and liked its location value for money I personally liked their beds very much Staff was always friendly and helpful ,neutral
 While checking in we found the staff member to be inexperienced and that the reservation staff had failed to take into account a previous reservation that had been cancelled and as a result insisted that we had to pay for two rooms Luckily after calling Booking Com they called the hotel and advised them that the initial reservation had been cancelled months ago In addition the bedding was below standard and the double bed consisted of two single beds pushed together with single mattresses that tended to slide off the bed each sideways each night The choices for food each evening consisted of either bar food snacks or an overpriced degustation restaurant Overall a very unsatisfying and disappointing experience Two of the ladies at the front desk were very helpful and easy to deal with ,neutral

 Room size too small  Very good location Clean room ,neutral

 Being called down to reception at midnight to pay our bill due to no one on check in taking our details Having housekeeping walk in a number of times before 11am and after 7 30pm Going for breakfast and having the plates cleared before we had finished there were no trays so if you wanted more then two items you had to go back Which we did we wanted fruit too Room service wasn t all that great kitchen apparently closes half an hour before it mentions and then the sandwiches offered on the late night menu are not worth the amount they charge you Charges added to our bill a day before we even checked in so they weren t us at all Minimal tea making facilities Only thing offered back after all the inconvenience was the two lots of the free 15 credit included in our room and a free upgrade if we ever wished to return which they managed to take from my account instead of put back  Stayed here as part of our anniversary getaway I had emailed someone a few days before we arrived to arrange something for our room Everything went to plan but quickly went wrong when we got there Overall lovely hotel with a great view from the bedroom and bathroom Great location East India is less than a 5 minute walk away and one stop from Canning Town where you can get the jubilee line Breakfast was fine as it was included wouldn t pay for it otherwise Staff were very unorganised and no one seemed to know what was going on Easy to get to Great location for O2 View from our room was as described Hotel was lovely,neutral

 We went to London as a special treat for my sister s 40th Birthday I chose the Hilton over other hotels and spent the extra cost to have a luxury stay at a reputable hotel compared to a budget hotel What we experienced was below the standard of even that The room had obviously previously been subject to a bathroom flood the carpet was stained from this and the room smelt mouldy The fridge was dirty the sink cracked and brown stains around the bath taps There was only enough milk for one person and had to ring for more There was tape residue left on the bottom of the bath where a mat had obviously previously been stuck and the decorating was of poor quality and was filthy around the skirting boards and door frames  It was just across the road from the Westfield Shopping Centre perfect after a hard days shopping ,neutral
 The airco making noise whole nightNo Positive,neutral
 The breakfast room was chaotic Cold plates no access to extra cutlery and dirty plates and cutlery left on tables We asked for milk and the jug was taken from a table that had just been vacated Scrambled eggs were cold Very poor for a 4 star expensive hotel  Good central location in the heart of London Easy access to both bus and Tube,neutral
