review,classification
The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.,bad
I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,bad
"This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.",bad
"First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second, i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also, he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it, but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa",bad
"Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy, shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.",bad
"This is a beautiful dress. however, it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also, i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person.",bad
This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.,bad
"I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue.",bad
I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.,bad
"I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.",bad
"Beautiful fabric! unfortunately, i had to return it. after just one wear, it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!",bad
"Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway, i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.",bad
I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them.,bad
The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.,bad
"It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.",bad
"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.
if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",bad
"As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging, i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah, that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size, and again in a larger size. unfortunately, i am sized out of these beauties.",bad
"The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.

i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.",bad
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",bad
"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding",bad
,bad
"This skirt looks great on, i didn't even think before buying it, planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design, not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates, it is not sewn in or built to last. 

then, it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it, but they said they would have to resew the whole garment, not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran",bad
"Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller, but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.
they are very soft and comfortable, but i wouldn't buy them again.",bad
"After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m, i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb, i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though, and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend, unless you wear 3xxxl",bad
"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model, where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was, i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7""",bad
"I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.",bad
"I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.",bad
"I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.",bad
"The design of this sweater is odd. it made me feel very ""round"" when i put it on. the sleeves were wide. the other reviewers were correct in saying that it's a thick sweater, which i thought i'd like. the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected. it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater.",bad
"I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.",bad
"Not great quality, runs a bit lose, disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area)",bad
I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.,bad
Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.,bad
"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.

i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material.",bad
Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin,bad
To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down,bad
The top is more of a cream color than an ivory. it's also a bit boxer than anticipated. fit is true to size.,bad
I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,bad
This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes,bad
"I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right, the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack, which it will because concensus is, it's way too long.",bad
"I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee, it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet",bad
"Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!",bad
These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,bad
"I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning",bad
"My v-shape figure (broad shoulder, narrow hips, waist not well defined) looked completely square in this. not flattering at all. perhaps better for other figures.",bad
"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back!",bad
"This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.

it's also not made very well.",bad
This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.,bad
,bad
"Got this in wine, very pretty and soft. but so sheer, even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.",bad
Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.,bad
The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.,bad
"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",bad
"I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.",bad
"I love this top! i ordered it in a medium, and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old, 5'2"", 125 lbs, for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!",good
"I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else.",good
"Currently wearing right now :)
purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l, and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath, as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.
a must at the tag sale price!",good
"I bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces. the top is amazing! it is soft, great fabric, a cute cut, and can be styled in so many ways! definitely worth the buy!",good
"I agree with others that the shape is not perfect, it does billow a bit by the hips. but the xxs petite (someone returned) was good on me. length was perfect, sleeve were not too tights. (30dd, 26.5 in waist, 35 in hips, 115 lbs)
colors are subdued, making the jacket more neutral. keeping in mind for later...",good

"This dress is gorgeous in person, but its very, very, very fitted. i wear a size 8 in most retailer dresses. i ordered the 8 and its not an option, not even with control undergarments. i sent the 8 back and re-ordered in a size 10. i wouldn't be surprised if i need the size 12. i hope it works because this is a beautiful dress. the pattern is stunning. the red is a deep brick shade. the fabric is thick, but not too thick to prevent transitioning from season to season. as other reviewers said, i am",good
"I found this skirt in a size 8 at my local retailer store. i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing. i tried it on and it fit beautifully, a style that looks great on my figure. i love the mohair weave of the color block sections. the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size 8 was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size 8 were very slim. i am still admirin",good
"I've eyed this dress forever and finally decided to buy it. i literally read every single review to make sure i ordered the right size. i'm 5'4-3/4"", 36c-32-37 with a drop-waist that measures 34. based on the reviews, i ordered a regular size 6. i tried it on with a bra and also without, and the dress fits so well and beautifully both ways. but for complete comfort, i'll probably go without the bra (the lining and design don't show anything you don't want seen!). sitting in it feels great too. i",good
Love this top (and every top tiny puts out).  runs very small.  i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top.  so pretty and great detail,good
True to size and love the color. great to wear dressed up with wedges and a blouse or dressed down with some mephistos and a tee. linen fabric makes them light for summer heat,good
"Love this dress! very flattering. material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great. it really does run small, like the other reviewers said -- glad i ordered one size up, fits perfectly!",good
This is an amazing looking skirt. it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering. it is very light weight though....almost flimsy. but...it is not a deal breaker. i wear it and love it!,good
"Really, this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit. it is just so very soft. the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it, making it very comfortable. it does have a tendency to fall towards the body, even though it's loose. so, i'd buy your regular size.

it's a thin material, but i don't think it's sheer at all. i bought the dark red/wine color and it's so classy! i love it. this will fit taller women easily because the arms and total length are on the long side (i sup",good
"This dress is gorgeous. flattering, comfortable, and machine washable!

for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 and 34dd. i got the medium and it fits great! only flaw is that the armholes are a little large, but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it.",good
"The top is adorable, but probably better to wait for a sale as the full price is a little high for a simple top like this. i got the print one and it's very true to size.",good
"Really cute top! love the ruffle detailing and the pattern. quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer. either way, i'm happy with the top. got my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it's meant to be a looser top so i don't mind that it runs a little bigger.",good
"I love this dress! i would definitely accessorize with a belt. my body type fits best in this style of dress because i don't have a big bust size, if you do i would try it on first. for being shorter, 5'3"", i love the length.",good
"I usually wear a 4, but ordered a 2 & 0 because of the previous reviews. the 2 fit perfectly. the 0 was too snug across the shoulders. both sizes were the same length and width except the shoulders.the material is beautiful and seems very well made. i am thrilled with this purchase.it looks exactly like the photo.",good
"Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3"") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!",good
"I loved this dress the moment i saw it, pre-ordered it, but when it arrived the fit was off. 
i am almost always a size 4p in retailer clothing, this fit wonderfully everywhere, except the shoulders and chest were very small. i am 5'2"" and 120 lb with a small bosom. (a cup) the shoulders were too tight and the chest gaped and sadly i had to return this dress.
i may try to find it in the store to try on multiple sizes for the right fit.",good
It's maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!,good
I loved this skirt. they didn't have my size anymore so i tried on a few others. i really needed a small p. otherwise i totally would have kept it!,good
"This top is an easy, classy staple for summer -tts and drapes well, great shape",good
"I was going to re-turn this.top  i was really on the fence.  so glad i didn't, it is.comfortable and easy to wear. lace is a little restrictive, but willing  to over look  it because i look so cute",good
Beautiful maxi fits tts. i normally wear a 10/12 and took a 12. it is flattering to the waist and makes me feel girly. the colors are so beautiful and the length is good for my 5'9 frame.,good
This is one of my favorite pair of pants. they don't stretch out while wearing and wash well. no pilling or shrinking. they can either be worn like leggings or pants. i wear a size 2 pants but got these in a 27 because i don't like them super fitted.,good
These jeans have become my new favorite pair! i bought two pairs during the clearance sale and wear them often. i love the metallic accents near the front pockets and the dark wash can be dressed up or down.,good
"I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return, etc. 
i love this so much!",good
"I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just 5'1"" - i didn't want to look like an extra from the set of ""newsies."" but these are very well made and tailored for a woman's body...the trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame. they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy. i love them!",good
"This definitely runs a little large, but i love this tee.  i actually went back and bought it in a second color. it's perfect to throw on with shorts this summer.",good
"I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!",good
"I bought this in a beautiful cornflower blue at my retailer store. i don't see that color for sale online. the blue material was not thin or see through, but perhaps the white is. the fit is very structured, which helps me cover my mom belly. i have never said this before, but i think it looks better on me than it does on the model wearing white. on sale, i got this for about $20. i got it for a steal. i like the different directions of line patterns and the length is nice too. one thing you can't",good
This dress is really really soft and comfortable. it's loose but still flattering. i would definitely recommend it.,good
"The photos really doesn't do this sweater justice. when i saw it in store ii was really drawn to the colors which are a bit brighter than they appear in the photos. this will be great over jeans or slim pants. i usually wear a l or xl and i went with the l which is still roomy enough to layer but not too big. at 5'5"" it drapes nicely and covers my rear end. the arms are a bit long on me but it is a common issue for me as i have short arms. others have mentioned the arms being big but i think the",good
"Love, love, this top! it's flattering (shows off your shoulders) soft and has delicate embroidery. i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as i'm very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs, just to see the difference. the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top. the xxs is a perfect length. it's my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long, long, time.",good
"I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out, it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.",good
"I never buy shorter shorts, my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering, but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model, but hit a nice spot on the leg, and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 115 lbs, all legs...",good
This top is just amazing. it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top.,good
"Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)",good
I see many uses for this sweater. it is so whimsical. i love it!,good
These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.,good
I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked. i ended up giving it to my daughter. it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit!!,good
"This sweater is so well made and uniquely designed. one of the main reasons i love retailer is for how toy make wool sweaters, timeless, affordable, and versatile.

worth the money!",good
Easy to take this dress from casual to dressy! super comfortable and cute!,good
"Love love love! i'm 5'8"", 122 lbs, 34b, and have an athletic frame (fairly narrow hips) and i bought an xs (in red.) usually i am a s with retailer for dresses (although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses), but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low back-design of the dress fit too loosely with the size s--it hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms, showing about 2"" of bra underneath. my guess is that if y",good
"I love this blouse. the color is so pretty! i might even wear this to a holiday party. the tie looks great so many ways--love the versatility. i think i will get a lot of wear out of this blouse--with a pencil skirt, jeans or under a blazer.",good
"I love this top so much. i dare say it is one of my favorite retailer purchases to date. i got it in the blue and it is really magical! i get compliments every time i wear it. i have a pair of dressier black leggings that i never know what to wear with, i'm not really a leggings person. but this tunic is exactly the piece! plus, this tunic comes with pockets. what's better than that??!",good

"The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.

very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!",good
"These jeans are awesome! i usually wear a 26 in ag jeans as they tend to stretch, but i ordered a 27p because i am only 5'1 and these are a flare style. i have a small waist but a larger booty, and these jeans hug me in all the right places. they also have a great dark color and are super classy so you can dress them up if need be. the only thing i didn't like was the length. even with the petite size i have to wear wedges so they don't drag on the ground. but, this is an issue i have with most",good
This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least 2 or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.,good
Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!,good
"I'm so glad i saw this pretty dress on sale as my eye overlooked when it was introduced. i have to agree with the previous reviewer that the zipper on this adorable dress is yucky to grab and zip. i also wish there were pockets but it's not a deal breaker. perfect dress for autumn/winter especially with a thin layer to wear underneath as the armholes are cut a bit large, showing my side boob and bra. i had to go two sizes up because 10p was sold out. skirt profile looks a little too wide, so i'l",good
"This dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own, especially for the hot summers. it is attractively loose, and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it. love it!",good
"I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work. i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous, but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didn't fit. i'm really happy i did because it's a gorgeous dress. you just may need to wear a different black slip with it (i did). if you already have one, it's no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique. it's the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for",good
"Great, rather heavyweight, long cardi. i purchased the blue, which is a lovely shade of gray/blue, not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater, but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5"", 136 lbs, 34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model.",good
"I love lace dresses and this one is no exception. great construction and color. i paired the dress with a plum colored blazer and i really was pleased at how well it all went together. i'm about 5'8"" and 170 i'm normally an 8 or 10 at retailer, my 8 fits great and is not tight at all, so i'm thinking it may run a tad bit big.",good
"This skirt is flattering and so soft. i've worn it once, and while it did keep feeling like a scandalous slit, i just had to keep reminding myself of the awesome inner skirt. i gave a 4 instead of 5 because my elastic seems to roll ever so slightly in front so that the pleats don't hang flat, and also a little bit of stitching on the outside was loose. since it's nothing that will unravel the whole thing, i'm not too worried about it.",good
"I love ag for their soft, stretchy denim and flattering fit. bought these today and couldn't be happier! i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size, but the ""regular"" capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle.",good
"Just bought this at the store. just to be safe, i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size. that was a good idea. ( i am a 38b, 5'9"", and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts.) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest. when directly compared to the medium, it seems the major difference is the length-- the large was > 1"" longer than the medium. i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok.",good
"Love the detail, quality of make and fabric, comfort.  i've been looking for a top like this.  expect that it  will wash fine. it's not see through and i always wear a nude bra.  got xs in white and it fits well, not too loose and billowy.  i'm 5'2"", 115#. highly recommend.",good
"This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!",good
"Aaaaaaamazing tunic, it was love at first sight and the detail is spot on. the total weight is heavier than expected but that is due to the impeccable quality of the top.",good
"I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4"" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.",good
The cut is wonderful and the fabric is soft and flowy. it is pretty sheer so a slip is recommended. i wish this dress had a lining like some other dresses i've gotten at retailer.,good
This blouse is perfect for a summer afternoon. it;s very light and the v neck back on it is super cute. the coloring is amazing. it's hard to find anything with those two colors incorporated. looks perfect with jeans or shorts and can be dressed up or dressed down. i am a solid 12 in everything...tops and bottoms and this shirt was no differemt. i like it a little loose so i went with my normal size but i am sure i could have gone down to a 10 as well. don't pass this up. it's a lovely lovely to,good
I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.,good
"Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me 
 i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips)
 if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned 
 great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length",good
I bought this b/c it looked exactly my style and i was right! i've worn this once and it is so comfortable and the fit is great. i can see this being a shirt i wear again and again all summer. i bought the black and am thinking about buying the peachy-plaid color...,good
"Wow, that dress is short... at least, the epite was, not falttering on muscular thighs... perhaps a regualr size on that one would work, but the bodice was a perfect fit, so not sure there... i decided not to try it on, as i figured this dress is very seasonal, and trendy. otherwise, if you ahve the money to spare and leaner legs,i would recommend it. the cut was actualyl flattering otherwise, i didn't have bunching issues like others, and my 30dd boobs fit in the 0p. color and pattern are prett",neutral
Cute design for a casual top. however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium. i returned it,neutral
I purchased these in large which is normally my size on bottom. they are a little roomy and the waist is so high on me that i am going to tack the waist down. they are ok. good quality but not the best pants in the world.,neutral
"I ordered this attractive top in my usual size and tried it on with great anticipation. it fit perfectly except across the shoulders, a problem i haven't encountered before. i've tried it on twice more (do i hope my shoulders will shrink?), only to see that it pulls across the top of the back as before. otherwise, it is so pretty and flattering that i'll be truly sad to send it back.",neutral
"Love the style, weight (not too hot) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans. i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue. very disappointed",neutral
"I love this top and the beading is beautiful, but just like everyone else, it was way too large. i normally wear a lg, but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large",neutral
"This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however, after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.",neutral
"I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however, the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.",neutral
The top is gorgeous and bohemian like with a loose fit. the top arrived with a small black stain and some of the lace already ripped. it might be too delicate for me to even exchange for another and wear. i am going to have to return it.,neutral
"I ordered this in the blue, it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back, but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top, but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted, 34-d, 5'3, 125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.",neutral
The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!,neutral
"Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he",neutral
"This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad, but unexpected. i am very short -waisted, and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished, and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.",neutral
"Beautiful fabric, but the fit was off. the picture makes the dress appear fitted than it actually is. the belt is definitely needed, but would leave a lot of fabric in the back of the dress giving it a less than tailored look. 

also, the arms and the top portion are a tad small, so if you have a larger bust/arms, this dress may be tricky. i am a 34b and the button in the xxsp was puckering a bit.i was really looking forward to this one for fall, but was no way for me to make it work.",neutral
"I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me, this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me, especially at this price point.",neutral
I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.,neutral
I absolutely adore this skirt! sadly it was a lot of skirt for me- i'm 5 feet nothing and it would have been too much fabric to hem. wish this skirt came in a petite size. great color and a fun option for the fall wedding season!,neutral
"Beautiful sweater dress. nice texture gorgeous pattern. however not for my body type! i'm 5'5"", a size 12-14 and i carry my weight in hips butt & tummy area. this dress is only slightly a line, almost straight and even the xl didn't look flattering on me. and the arms are definitely smaller and weird too-there is bunching in the pit area. i tried on a large for comparison and it was too tight all over and there was a button missing too. this def. runs small and i think will be flattering on the",neutral
"Picked this up in the store today, but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo, but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing, but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l",neutral
"I am a sweater girl, so i was really looking forward to this cozy-looking piece. like other reviewers, i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured. i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp. i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit. it did not fit like the model at all. the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly. the length was not as long as pictured, but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long. others suggested sizi",neutral
"This top is pretty and i did not find it sheer at all but i am returning it due to the lace sleeves are tight. but, i do have large arms! other than the sleeves i would keep it!",neutral
"After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try, but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8, smaller on top, and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also, the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.",neutral
"Love the color and style, but material snags easily",neutral
"I purchased these pants in blue, they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.",neutral
"Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though!
if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!",neutral
This blouse ran so short in the body it has to go back. it would not cover my stomach untucked or tucked in. it's unfortunate i think it would be very beautiful and flowey.,neutral
I wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off. it stretched so much. i'm going to beg my local store to take back. it shouldn't fall apart like that. it's super duper cozy though.,neutral
"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger",neutral
"I ordered this in a petite small; a petite xs would have fit too. fits just like on the model. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37ish with narrow shoulders and torso. the regular size proportions would have been off on me. lovely pattern on a milky white background.
.
i'm returning it because it feels so scratchy, much more than a linen tee i got from retailer a few years ago and that i love, especially in hot weather. with this one i would also need to wear a cami under it, as even my nude bra showed",neutral
,neutral
"I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want",neutral
"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms, all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra",neutral
"Material is a little think and they run a bit long like many other retailer pants. otherwise, a great deal if you get them on sale.",neutral
"I love holding horses and i am always be size 2 in their clothes (32dd, 5'3"", curvy). i ran into my local retailer to grab a shirt they had on hold and had to try this on because it's so cute. i couldn't get the 2 zipped and it seemed to be rather narrow in the torso. such a bummer!",neutral
It is very sheer which is too bad because the design is super cute.,neutral
"When i received this tank, i ordered the blue, i almost returned it because it seemed really thin, almost see through. however, once i tried it on it had a good fit, not see through, just lightweight and breezy. i especially like the twisted details on the straps. i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort, especially because it is on the thin side.",neutral
"I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder, like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however, the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top, you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.",neutral
"I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i""m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large.",neutral
"I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great, but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look, but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable, the navy color is really pretty.",neutral
"I recommen only becuase i like it on other people, but not on me. the pull on style didn't work, i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist, but the waist wasn't elastic enough to ""pull up"" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae, i am 5'1.5"" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea, btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#",neutral
The fit on these is frustrating. with l space you almost have to try everything on first because the sizing is different from one cut to the other. i wear a 25/26 jean and a medium in this bottom still felt and looked too small.,neutral
I purchased the 0p online and it was so incredibly short on me it wouldn't even serve as a tunic!! it was also so tight in the bust area that i could not pull it down because there is absolutely no give in the material. the berry color was not as bright as it had appeared online but in fact was a very muddled color that seemed to make the material look even more cheap. i would need to size up considerably to have good fit without give in the bust and arms and judging by the structure of the dres,neutral
"I wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose, body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.",neutral
"I love the unusual print, but the cut didn't work for me. i've got a round back side and a sway back, and the dress made me look twice as big front to back than i actually am because there's no shaping to help it adjust to the curves. so sad!",neutral
"I wanted to love this dress so much but it just looked frumpy no matter what i did. i'm normally a 14, and i bought a size 12 and it still looks very baggy and not flattering. i'm sad because in photos it's my favorite dress of all time!",neutral
I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.,neutral
"I want to love this shirt but it isn't happening. the proportions shown on the model are not how this shirt ends up fitting. the fabric is super soft and the pattern is great, if the fit works for you.",neutral
Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.,neutral
"I got the pink version. it is a pretty color, but the metallic border is painted, not a metallic yarn. the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy. it looks cheap to me--not what i expect from retailer. am returning.",neutral
"I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining, so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price, the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise, it's beautiful skirt, flowy and very feminine.",neutral
"Drawn to the colors, i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 or l in fitted tops
this top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams.",neutral

 I forgot my gold jewellery in the safe in the hotel room and contacted the hotel as soon as I got back Fortunately the hotel had found them and agreed to send it to us by express mail if we pay for the charges which we happily did When the jewelries arrived we were shocked to discover all gold pieces were missing and the other jewelries were sent to us We informed the hotel but neither the hotel nor the courier MBE and UPS takes responsibility for the missing pieces and tell us off by pointing at each other Although a nice hotel we are deeply disappointed in our experience with this hotel and would never go back NOT RECOMMENDED Nice room and lobby,bad

 The problem has happened both times we stayed at the property hot water goes of in the middle of the night so in the morning it s a freezing shower also water completely turns off throughout the day around 2 3 times for 3 4 hours which means no water to use for making tea washing your face a the odd shower someone wants in the day all these are not possible Please check that the pillow covers have definitely been changed when you inspect them carefully you can see the hair gel the wax and in my experience some blood which I found when I turned the pillow over asking the reception to changes these is a night mare as they have the classical hotel excuse of cleaners are only available in the mornings sir No fridge very dusty the cleaners literally clean it so quick that upon a glance it looks clean but when you spend 5 minutes you can see how dirty the place really is not recommendable at all  It has a nice location of course being in Canary Wharf ,bad

 Black mould in the bathroom the bathroom facilities were quite dated and needed to be refurbished with quite a lot of dirt between the tiles Disappointed with the lack of cleanliness of the bathroom for a four star hotel The view from our window was a graveyard which although is not the worst thing in the world I would expect a bit a clarity that was a possibility when booking your stay Our major gripe was the poor service provided by the reception staff who were generally not helpful had absolutely no common sense and could not comprehend the concept of good communication or customer service The s standard response that was given to everybody with a request or a complaint was I will have to ask the manager After taking payment upon our arrival which we assumed was payment for our accommodation we were informed on check out this was in fact not the required payment for the room and we had to make another payment for the room The receptionist decide to cancel my previous transaction and request full payment rather than charge me the outstanding 8 Due to this I am currently unable to access to the initial payment of 200 as it is still allocated or within a shadow by my credit card provider Overall we were generally disappointed with our stay No Positive,bad

 When I arrived late in the evening they just told me they had given away the room put me into a taxi and sent me to another bad hotel in another part of town where I did not want to be but only after they forced me to pay the invoice for the room which I never saw which I had to accept because I did not have anywhere else to go They had my phone number and e mail so they could have asked me at any time if I were going to show up which by the way I always did every single time I booked there since I have an important client just mext door but they did not After very little sleep I had to get up earlier the next day and take a taxi which I obviously had to pay for myself to reach my client where I spent the rest of the day fighting against headaches and exhaustion courtesy of this appalling establishment  Nothing,bad
 Noise from trains in rooms at rear of hotel  Good location Great staff,bad
 The location was terrible and meant so much travel to get to any of the nice areas Unfortunately our room was very uncomfortable with a bad bed and pillows a smell from the air conditioning and was very small and dingy for over 125 night The worst part was the terrible value for money one of the worst hotels I ve stayed in for this Had a beautiful hotel in Girona the week after which was a fraction of the price but which gave such attention to the guests and their comfort unlike the Senator  They had an ice dispenser on our floor and a minibar of complementary drinks ,bad

 We were surprised to see bed n breakfast like service in such a big hotel brand and costly too There was no room service Even we need to go and buy water bottle also from Reception area At least a vending machine would have given the feel of descent bed n breakfast hotel but they were shamelessly selling the water bottles also from Reception Breakfast was also too simple Not worth spending so much money for just a brand Similarly Clean bed n breakfast would be available at fraction of cost No Positive,bad

 For a hotel costing so much is I it really beyond them to be able to put a small bottle of water in a guests room When questioned I was told you have to be a holiday inn loyalty club member to qualify for a free bottle of water You cannot make it up Add 50 p per night I suggest to the already exorbitant room rate And include a comp bottle of water It won t burst your profit margin Water and add ons are replacing hat old profit centre of the past the hotel phone bill Mobiles put paid to that profit centre But it s been replaced with crazy high wi fi charges and paying for drinking water Scandalous This hotel not the only offenderNo Positive,bad
 Everything Nothing,bad

 First of all we checked in and there was stains all over our bed sheets after unpacking we decided to get a shower and freshen up before going back out The drains made the smell of the bathroom almost unbearable My partner used the shower where we found the hook for the shower wasn t secure which made the actual shower head fall off and smack him in the face causing him to have a black eye Before we went out we passed this on to the staff who may I add was lovely young girl with dark hair she said she would look into getting the shower fixed and bed sheets changed we said we d see if the smell of the room had calmed down before we had to move as we had unpacked and we had little time to start with and loads we wanted to do We didn t arrive back while 3am the next morning and to our surprise the shower head was still in the same position unfixed the bedding was still stained but the smell of the drains had gone so we stayed in the room and decided we would mention it the next morning as it was late and been on the 11th floor it was a bit of an inconvenience having to go all way back down we where really disappointmented that the staff had made promises to them just ignore our requests When we went down stairs the next morning we mentioned it to the staff on reception who was really rude advising basically that she wasn t going to do anything because we didn t mention it last night as soon as we got back try going to the 11th floor at 3am and wanting to come back down we left it with her hoping something would get sorted Arrived back that evening still nothing had been done and also NO fresh towels and the smell of the drain was back As we where checking out the next morning we left it and decided we would right a complaint instead When we woke up the morning to pack there was a beetle type creature crawling in our bed sheets the same mucky stained ones wed litrally stripped of the bed and slept with only the pillow  The room and hotel was very modern and we where put on the top floor as requested despite having to walk up stairs due to lift not going all the way up we where told this when checked in so no problem ,bad

 As a longtime Booking com customer I have noticed that places are not always as good as the reviews lead one to believe however this place was so bad in every possible way I suspect the positive reviews cannot be true This motel is located in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood with nothing nearby I did not feel safe with my family Everything is 15 minutes away walking metro coffee a bite to eat everything The hotel is dark old and had an odor I could write in the dust on the top of the shelves One of our rooms smelled like sewage we complained to the front desk but the smell remained We overlooked the hotel back alley that was cluttered with junk and the staff was kind enough to wake us up talking loudly during their 6 30 am smoke break The beds looked normal until you sat on them several inches of mattress would suddenly disappear under the lightest compression I had back problems for weeks after the visit and had to visit a physician Unfortunately in the rush to leave with three small children we left our Amazon Kindle in the room We noticed it missing as soon as we got to the airport Called the hotel and explained the exact location where it would have fallen between the bed and wall and followed up with several detailed emails Of course the device was never found in the room This horrible experience does not even consider the fact that when my mother was in an accident and couldn t fly we had to fight to get the dates changed until after her recovery I understand no refunds but this should have been an easy exception and they kept the money for the additional day we did not use when we re booked It was just a horrible place all around Not only will I avoid the brand at all costs in the future but I now feel that I can no longer trust Booking com and I will not be using them in the future  The staff at the front counter was courteous but it was a minimum effort and the least of what you would expect here in London ,bad

 When we arrived and got our room it was a big chunk of hair in the shower I went to the reception and told them this and they said they would arrange it It was in the shower during out whole stay Room wasnt very clean either and we found hair basicly everywhere They could use a vacuumcleaner During our stay they only cleaned the room once Wifi really bad to Sometimes it worked and sometimes not and when it worked it was very slow No Positive,bad
 difficult to reach with public transport only one bus line The hotel looks worn out and run down Food in the local restaurant was really bad and expensive Breakfast was not included and WIFI cost 9 EUR for a day which works only for one device and sometimes the access code gets invalid and you have to ask the Reception for a new one All in all one of the worst hotels i have stayed in I can t fathom how they can have more than 2 stars  room was ok,bad

 Honestly The whole experience was great I definitely recommend the hotel My only thought here is it is probably cheaper to get breakfast at one of the nearby cafes than eat at the hotel  I love this hotel Upon check in the staff immediately greets you with a welcome glass of champagne and also gives you an overview of the city with recommendations on restaurants and attractions The rooms are great and pretty spacious The style is transitional modern and contemporary but still the character of an older building We were celebrating a special occasion so they gave us a bottle of champagne and chocholates in the room A great treat I really enjoyed the area of town as well It s not far from luxury shopping or the city centre and in walking distance to most local attractions The beach was under a 10 euro cab ride I definitely will be staying at this hotel when I come back to Barcelona ,good

 I was a little disappointed with the room Myself and my wife booked a double room but the room had two single beds pushed together When you moved on the bed the beds pushed apart and you d end up nearly falling inbetween the two  The location of the hotel was fantastic near the metro and the local railway The hotel is only a stone s throw from a whole host of sights There are plenty of restaurants littered around the hotel to suit any taste and budget The staff are friendly and the hotel is both clean and well presented ,good

No Negative Great breakfast choice fresh made omelettes with real eggs not a premix ,good
 Smokers ALWAYS blocking the entrance staff at breakfast take no care in the amount of noise they make when clearing tables and stacking them on trolleys it was over bearing also we came down to BF with 3 4 hr left to closure but the food selection was diminished and not refilled for 15 euro each not worth it  was chosen for proximity to main train station Staff courteous and efficient at front desk Rooms good size very comfy really appreciated the complementary water and soda ,good

 The heating System  Very friendly and efficient staff The missing hair dryer was replaced within minutes ,good

 improved internet would have been handy  great breakfast selection,good
No Negative Having stayed at the hotel previously we requested a room on the top floor which we were given The breakfast that they offer on the 1st floor is very good always fresh croissants etc The beds and pillows are very comfortable as sometimes in hotels the beds tend to dip in the middle not in this hotel The location is excellent plenty of restaurants in the area the underground is 1 minutes walk away ,good
 Nothing It was a fantastic stay at superb small but exclusive property Great location lovely rooms and very helpful staff,good
 The room was small and rather shabby  The location was perfect Great for exploring Bloomsbury and very close to tube station ,good

 Upon arrival the welcoming was great howvever you then go in to the reception area and found the staff a little bit rude Other than that great all around  Fabulous hotel Location is superb with fantastic views of Barcelona city Hotel provides everything you want for a great holiday The hotel kindly gave us a free birthday cake as this trip was on behalf of my girlfriends birthday found this really welcoming and respectful ,good
 the standard rooms are quite small and there is not much storage space  Friendly and very helpful staff small but very delicious breakfast buffet french cheese and ham selection fresh fruits fresh juices very comfortable bed Free Nespresso at the room great metro connection to the city center ,good
No Negative The hotel gave us upgrade in our rooms to city view that s wonderful ,good
 The Wi Fi on the 4th floor was rather spotty and tended to kick out more frequently than I would have liked It was usually resolved after disconnecting and reconnecting every so often but it made using the laptop just more cumbersome than strictly necessary  We were awed by their attention to detail uniqueness of each room tastefulness of decoration and above all their 100 dedication to sustainability For example the hotel generates a huge percentage of their electricity through solar panels in downtown Vienna no less Every bite of food is organic and locally sourced or produced in house Strictly Fair Trade Tea and coffee are even imported by a CO2 emission free sail ship http fairtransport eu ships tres hombres Staff was very attentive at all times from early mornings to late at night and unwavering accommodating It goes to show that you can successfully operate a business and be environmentally conscious and maintain a good relationship with your staff and guests Great example and impressive ,good

No Negative This hotel is quiet private and chic If you like the feeling of privacy in a beautiful place and a cool neighborhood this is the hotel for you This is not one of those grand hotels and so the hallways are a bit too narrow and some of the rooms are not as great as others I think this all adds to the charm of the place and the sense of history The staff was friendly and helpful Even the ladies who cleaned the rooms were sweet Don t miss out on having breakfast in the 2 beautiful rooms downstairs Really a treat This was our 2nd time there and we were upgraded to a family suite which was a wonderful surprise We were 3 and had 2 bedrooms a living room and 2 bathrooms It was for us a very memorable stay ,good
No Negative Hotel is in a great location having the metro station around 6 mins away walking through the park The room was very clean the staff were more than helpful The restaurant staff are very polite too Didn t have one single complaint Only a few stops away from the main shopping areas by metro The whole journey will take less than 10 mins Recommended Hotel A ,good

 Nothing Good all round service,good
 The fact that we could not stay longer  Staff made our stay special as it was a special occasion that we were there Beds were extremely comfortable rooms were spotless with lovely touches throughout ,good
 Quite cool in the reception area needs heating or an open fire to compliment the building No hot water for a shower on the evening or the following morning staff were very very good and issue with the above was resolved but put a dampener on the trip  Location in a quiet street location to the tube and local shops,good
 The only grumble is no on site parking can t be helped with the location but offering the NCP parking facilities is a lot cheaper and closer to the hotel  The staff were so friendly and the hotel itself was simply amazing We stayed in an executive room so had access to the lounge again just made us feel extra special Top hotel we will definitely be staying again,good
 Rooms facing the front are very noisy  Location is great Restaurant very good and price very reasonable Restaurant manager and staff are very friendly and professional ,good

 They did not have connecting rooms As we are a family of 5 with a 11yo 8yo and 5yo we had book 2 rooms The rooms were on the same floor  Location was great Walking distance to metro city tour bus stop and Ramblas Street ,good
 As mentioned the hotel lies in between two derelict buildings in a largely residential location We were travelling with an infant and required a kettle which took over 24 hours to arrive despite repeated requests  The hotel was very nice Room was large and breakfast was good Value for money was superb 10 minute walk to the underground train station Free parking ,good

No Negative Did not have breakfast,good
 The card in the bathroom mentioned a lot of complimentary items such as razor shaving gel comb etc however we never saw them in the bathroom this was not a major problem since we had our stuff with us anyway yet I wonder why the management offered something when they didn t provide it The room had only two bath towels which is a bit difficult to deal with when one of the guests has long hair and thus needs two towels herself The management really ought to put in a couple of extra towels in the wardrobe  The hotel is close enough but not too close to Kings Cross and the Euston Road artery You can be in central London Russel Square Victoria station Covent Garden etc within 20 30 mins on the Northern line and the buses I agree that they are slower nevertheless they are more comfortable since you don t have to breathe in the bottled air and stand in a crowded tube can take you there too Angel has excellent cafes pubs and restaurants We had all the meals there There are many shops and the normal brands of supermarket and a proper market Chapel Street St Mary s and St Silas s churches and Sadlers well theatre are nearby Buses 207 73 and 30 stop right next to the hotel Angel tube is a few minutes walk away Check in and check out were smooth The room was spacious for London clean and tidy and the soundproofing was excellent Proper controllable AC was present in the room Excellent staff gave us all the time when we took a extra time to check out They also have 24 hour manned front desk we came back in the wee hours of the morning D ,good

 Rooms are comfortable but compact Excellent location very helpful staff nicely furnished and comfortable,good
No Negative I couldn t fault a single thing My boyfriend and I arrived in Amsterdam on Friday and the staff couldn t have been more welcoming or helpful The hotel was immaculate loved the quirky interior design We were very impressed with the room as it was a perfect size for a couple and loved that you could control everything from the mood lighting to the blinds and television through the IPad Location is brilliant tram stop number 5 was right outside our hotel which allows you to go all the way to centraal station and Zuid Station was a 5 minute walk at the very most The worst part was having to check out not because it was stressful it was the easiest procedure of checking in and out that i have ever experienced but because we had to leave Thank you for having us CitizenM we will definitely be back in the near future ,good
 The pool terrace seemed understaffed in the early evenings Drinks were expensive when compared to similar venues in the city  The staff were very helpful and the room beautiful Overall a very luxurious hotel in a central position ,good

No Negative Bed the best we ve slept in Cookies on arrival best ever,good
 No hot option for breakfast  Room was very comfortable location perfect Four stops from city centre but nice atmosphere lively where we were ,good
 Spent the day in the spa except the hammam suite was not in use There was a sign on the door of the suite saying that it was booked for a private party although we did not see anyone leave or enter the hammam suite all day Nobody could withstand the heat in the suite for more than 20 minutes let alone all day I suspect the suite might have been broken but instead of admitting this a phoney excuse was given I suspect anyway Also when in the spa a group of young male teenagers proceeded to take photos of themselves in the pool and using the facilities I found this rather uncomfortable and no member of staff seemed to approach them on why they were taking pictures in a spa I just didn t feel it was up to 5 star standard unfortunately However room was lovely and comfortable and the location is great for the theatre district  Room was lovely very stylish and bed was very comfortable ,good

 When arriving an hour up to end of car parking feel there should be a concessionary free hour  Every member of staff was friendly welcoming and extremely helpful The car parking facilities were good Easy to find ,good
 The room was clean Had no idea what room to expect but to come in with lots of flies flying around in your room that s just unhygienic They gave us a room facing the street and because we were staying on the weekend it was so noisy someone was having a party and we didn t get any sleep till 3am every night and then people checking out at 5am leaving their room woke us up too because you can just hear everything My girlfriend left her jacket on the Eurostar and I asked in the reception if they could talk in french and ask if anyone had hand it in by any chance and they didn t bother to just said leave early and ask for yourself  The location is brilliant short walking distance to the Eiffel tower Taxi service was very fast too They also let us leave our luggage with them after check out which was helpful ,good

 The hotel automatically takes an extra 60 hold on top of your hotel stay which was not mentioned when I booked in case you spent more Because I only wanted a hotel with good location and facilities to cater for a family whilst travelling on my own with two children I thought this was a bit off However I explained this and I offered to pay up front for my stay and they accepted that  Location was great just off Trafalgar square tube near by close to the riverside and close to theatre with a little Tesco next door but one Stayed in family room which had a fridge kettle and microwave so nice to be able to sort a warm drink out on at bedtime and simple breakfast in the morning and of course have a bottle of wine chilling after a long day out and about Staff really friendly and helpful Asked for more pillows as they was only one each and we all like two and they were waiting for us on return ,good

 The shower within the bedroom is a bit too trendy and doesn t actually work within the room set up The pillows were terrible Sorry  The location is excellent and we were made to feel very welcome and nothing was a problem coffee and cake late afternoon with some wine in the bar is a must Breakfast upstairs on the rooftop restaurant is a great start to the day ,good

No Negative friendly staff clean room great location,good
 Wifi was not that good  Great location nice rooms and friendly staff ,good
 A little on the expensive side like most of Amsterdam  Excellent hotel close to museums and walking distance to downtown ,good
 Rooms are small but we knew that Lack of storage drawers wardrobes is an issue but not a big one The worst fault is that the rooms at the front are very poorly insulated against noise Not much traffic in mid Soho but large numbers of very noisy people emerging from next door bars until the small hours Then dustcarts collecting rubbish and reversing noisily at 6 30 A modern 4 hotel in London shouldn t have these issues which would deter future visits  Cheerful staff Efficient response to queries Large comfy bed ,good
 No telly in room Modern close to tube great concept,good
 Room was very tired and in need of refurbishment  Location was excellent and staff couldn t be more helpful ,good

 Smell of drains in bathroom and couldn t check into room on arrival so had to get changed in storage room to go out for the day Location was great Rooftop pool and bar area had amazing views of city Really nice rooms and lovely brand new bathroom,good
 The person who checked me in on the reception desk was miserable and unhelpful Added no value and provided no information passed me a form to sign and the key and didn t even tell me where the room was When I asked simply pointed to the lift He said 2 or three words to me came across rude and in my opinion should never work in a customer service role  The room was clean spacious and comfortable ,good

 No cons come to mind  Visited Paris for the weekend with my 13 yr old daughter as she wanted to practice her French I chose the Scribe for it s location and figured with the Sofitel name beside it it would be acceptable We were not disappointed The location was great within walking distance to the things we wanted to do and see The reception upon check in was warm and welcoming And our room was upgraded without asking The room itself was modern spacious for Paris comfortable and had a small balcony overlooking the street The staff was very polite and always helpful especially the Concierge Service team Emmanuelle with whom I had spoken prior to our arrival with inquiries about possible language activities for my daughter was a complete delight She spoke in French with my daughter the whole time gave helpful suggestions of places to visit and even gave her a lovely parting gift a charming book in French We also had dinner at the hotel restaurant Simply delicious As with the other staff members the restaurant staff was helpful polite and very attentive In all it was a lovely albeit short stay and I say merci beaucoup to the staff at the Scribe We will definitely be returning ,good
 No complaints at all  Very good breakfast really close to metro just a 2 min walk literally easy access to all attractions cozy and large bed ,good
No Negative Loved the decor and the luxurious bathroom Location was perfect for us ,good
 Noise The room was facing the street Noise is normal it is a busy street even at night you can hear ambulances and police cars The problem isn t the street the windows isolation I very poor The window frame and rest of the window structure isn t very adequate  Breakfast is good English and continental are very complete However is no easy to understand what s included in our room rate and not At the breakfast room lobby you are informed that the breakfast is or isn t included after seating you receive a menu with prices you need to ask several times the stuff if this or that is included Nice is the kindness from the stuff they are really helpful,good
 none Great location nice staff good breakfast room facilities makes me come back each year,good
No Negative Great stay I traveled with my daughter who was actually going to Tobago flying from London We wanted to have some time together before her big university trip I emailed the reception asking for a room with a nice view I got much more that I expected On the arrival we got two complimentary drinks we could decide what we want They did not offer us a chip wine In the room my daughter found lots of balloons and a card The card was prepared by a lovely member of staff Teela She made a huge effort as the card was containing some images from Tobago and a nice story It was a great personal touch Thank you The room itself is not very specious but it is lovely The bed is extremely comfortable Everything is operated by an iPad Lights TV there is a great sellection of movies The hotel Location is great Is literally next to the Tower Hill underground station The reception is nice and modern There are also computers you can use At the bar you can buy some food good selection for a very reasonable price The second night was interrupted by a fire alarm but this things happen I got an email in the morning explaining the situation and apologising for this I would highly recommended the hotel to everyone traveling to London for business or leisure and I will definately stay in the hotel again ,good
 The only improvement I could suggest is the coffee situation in the morning The espresso machine takes a tad bit of time and creates a high waiting time I suggest having a large pot of coffee also available I m just being nit picky though  Overall the hotel was great in terms of location and price It s located literally 45 seconds away from the metro station on foot The breakfast package we selected was a great option Tons of delicious breakfast items to choose from Our room was spacious with very high ceilings The staff was very friendly ,good
No Negative We had a room to the back and it was quiet the room clean and the bathroom and shower very good I liked the 24 hour open shop in the hotel,good
 Room was small and dark only had a few recessed lights  Staff were friendly and polite The bed was very comfortable and the room and bathroom very clean Towels changed every day Lovely buffet breakfast available and good service ,good
 Nothing at all  The kindness of the reception attention of the staff and comfort of the Bed The Concierge always at the door greeting you is making you feel at home Extra thank you to the Concierge that can speak in Japanese ,good
 two beds joined together meant we had a dip in the missle  Dim Sum for breakfast ,good
 Nothing to do with hotel but the access to the hotel and London traffic sucks The rooms are huge some very helpful staff plus onsite parking beautiful view great location also a free shuttle to local tube and over ground stations,good
 Room size The room was very small and there was no bath and no toilet brush but we had a good stay location was great for what we needed,good
 There were some works being carried out but any disruptions were kept to an absolute minimum  Staff were very friendly and helpful ,good

 Woken up by people walking around the room above during the night  Good all round hotel great pub atmosphere excellent choice for breakfast ,good
 The room was lovely but my only complaint would be its a little small It was quite hard to move around and was especially hard to open and close the bathroom door if you were in the bathroom as there was no room  Location was great Only a 10 minute walk to Hyde Park to visit Winter Wonderland We had prosecco and strawberries sent to our room in the evening to celebrate our anniversary and the bar lady was very friendly and helpful Breakfast in the morning was delicious aswell Everything was clean and the bar was well stocked aswell Always a bonus ,good
 Nothing Everything Location ,good

No Negative Bed very comfy ,good
 Couldn t work out how to deal with the heating but it was OK in the end didn t bother me as much The bed was so comfy The room was amazing,good
 Well if you need WiFi you can be dissappointed Neither me nor my bf could connect with Internet guy on Reception wasn t very able to help so we had to invest this 20 euro and buy two sim cards with 1GB each to be in touch with work  Location was extremely good really it s close to every attraction and also great in this city sightseeing way It s nice building on one side view is on Catedral I think on the other on full of life street very energetic Room was cosy clean bathroom also nice with great shower and strong it s rare hairdryer ,good
 The lack of storage meant vacuum cleaners where on the stairs in front of the lift of each level however was not in the way the lift was very small and slow so sometimes its just better to take the stairs  The staff in this Hotel were all very professional polite and helpful The location is fantastic minutes walk from the metro bus stops and the alleys beside the hotel are full of great places to eat and explore ,good
 Nothing I can t think of anything we could find fault with  The room was great and the breakfast was beyond our expectation Everyone we dealt with at the front desk or restaurant couldn t have been nicer or more helpful One of the best hotel experiences we have ever had ,good
 Tiny room Dirty floor dirty toilets shower head full of limescale Dirty table stove and toaster Tatty No lift or phone to contact reception Very disappointed Misleading website  The bed was clean and the location was pretty good but some of the local residents were very dodgy ,neutral

 The furniture is very simple there is no carpete in the rooms the heating makes noise This hotel is good if you are in tranzit Every things looks very simple for a 4 stars hotel The breakfast is very expensive 25 90 for what is offers Parking,neutral
 Renovation in progress Bed very comfortable,neutral
 not a 4 Star hotel I would say 2 maybe rooms were small and AC didnt work location was close to the activities around,neutral
 The description of the hotel says u can enjoy breakfast however not every room contains such an offer The description of the room offer is also not clear as to whether breakfast is included The price of the breakfast is not mentioned anywhere in the hotel and the charges are made without prior consultation to the guest The staff of the restaurant was quite rude to me when I said I was surprised with the charges that were being made to me First time this kind of thing ever happened to me when using booking com I would say you can find better offers in the city Aparently they also blame the guests for employees being too expensive in Italy wtf  Rooms are confortable but old Renovation would be advisable Staff is ok but a bit too rude in general ,neutral
 Rooms are small however adequate  Staff very friendly and efficient nice breakfast and was able to leave luggage there while at work on the last day ,neutral

 The room space was small and did not present big enough for two people The air con took ages to become cool which was horrible considering we had opted in having a bedroom with no window there was a window but it couldn t open  The hotel staff and kitchen staff were polite and friendly from arrival to departure ,neutral
 I really don t think that you can class this hotel 4 when I arrived there were not towels so I had to ask at the desk for some I came back to the hotel from the city around 23 15 and there was no room service available nor were any of their cafes restaurants open for me to get food On the website it says that both the Savoy Cafe and Bar are open until 24 00 Mon Sunday but neither were open at 23 15 The only way I could get food or drinks was from a vending machine with limited choices There s no way of turning off the lights which are within the bathroom mirror which meant I had a poor night sleep I feel like I am being harsh as the staff were friendly but there is no way this is a 4 hotel and given I paid 150 EUR for 1 night I found it a little disappointing  The location of the hotel is great for business trips because you are close to the business parks and also to the metro station that takes you straight into the heart of Amsterdam takes about 15 minutes Staff were also friendly ,neutral
 Personnel du comptoir du Check outNo Positive,neutral
 Unfriendly or at least uninterested staff in general Small gym with equipment not working properly Lack of iron available on request  Good breakfast Nice bar Good shower ,neutral

 Decor and smell Hotel has major sewer problem was told last time I stayed I would be taken care of this time but ended up in smaller room and had to upgrade and pay extra 200 to get ok room,neutral
 Small stuffy room Could hear either hot water or heating running all time room dimly lit and light outside toilet was on timer sensor and kept switching off Bathroom small could not believe in 2015 having paid for room and breakfast they want GBP10 00 for WIFI This should be normal to be included these days Water from cold tap was warm so obviously running too close to hot pipe not nice to clean teeth in warm water or grab glass to drink in the night  Location breakfast breakfast staff service bag attendance whilst shopping for day after checkout ,neutral

 We were given a disabled room and were not informed before of this before we were shown to our room The bed was advertised to us as a large double bed but was a queen bed and felt that the website was misleading  Breakfast was lovely and pantry was an amazing bonus ,neutral
 Staff attitude disengaged and poorly trained A huge drop in service levels and staff competence compared to 2 years ago when I stayed about 25 nights at the hotel over one year Breakfast room closed directed to a cheap version of a continental breakfast temporary set up on the first floor canteen feel  Excellent location on Sloane Square ,neutral
 The toilet is terrible  There bathroom has no light teevee is dead off I hate it ,neutral

 We could hear the room next door Dry martini was way over priced Near a tube station and free wifi,neutral
 bathrobe and sleepers were not included Furniture of the room,neutral
 Unresponsive ness of staff especially front desk staff On some occasions calls to the reception are not picked The front desk staff apart from one lady that is a manager are unmoved and certainly unwilling to assist For eg I almost missed my flight because I was at the reception begging them to detail a staff to help me with my luggage as I was checking out They just mopped at me helplessly I was forced to take a trolley to my room and started carrying my luggage contrary to my doctors advise I have been in pains since then  The hotel is always kept neat ,neutral
 Room temperature was often too hot or too cold in the night Bathroom was a little small so while I loved the water pressure I was often fearful of soaking the bathroom When the room was cleaned it was not thorough While the beds were made and the floors tidied cleaned mugs were not replaced with fresh tea coffee sugar and creamer The lady at the front desk when checking out was not very friendly  Nice amenities and toiletries Nice decor Fantastic Water pressure The gentleman at the bar was very helpful in finding somewhere nearby for us to eat The hotel was reasonably close to the Champs Elysees which was very convenient for our New Years Eve stay we saw the fireworks at the Arch de Triumph ,neutral

 REALLY NOISY PLACE WOKE UP BY THE STAFF ABOUT 10 TIMES ON THE MORNING AND THIS START AT 6AM REALLY GOOD BATHROOM,neutral
 the hotel room was filthy and infested with bugs Had to be moved into another room which wasn t very nice either  The location was good close to the tube,neutral
 Location very uncomfortable beds rooms need a face lift over pricedDisappointing Helpful staff,neutral
 The rooms were falling apart The bed had bugs I was bitten on my leg The toilet seat kept falling down and smacking into my back whilst I was engaged The room was in dire need of decoration The hair dryer blew up There was a huge pool of water on the window sill The restaurant staff had no idea what gluten free meant and I am convinced that my gluten free toast was cross contaminated somewhere in the kitchen But apart from that  It was in a good location for the meeting we had the next day ,neutral
 The noise at night made it impossible to sleep The one bedroom apartments are situated in quite a dodgy stretch of Warwick Road right next to it Our apartment had not been properly sound proofed so the traffic noise filtered directly into the apartment In fact it seemed to be amplified We tried everything closing the windows using noise cancelling apps and nothing worked There was also a regular thump from within the apartment when we used the air conditioning unit This unit was quite hard to adjust having one central control next to the door of the apartment some distance from the master bedroom We had a long flight the next day and were exhausted during our journey and even more so when we arrived We felt cheated because we wanted to stay in Kensington to rest before our journey and requested a quiet room In addition the location for the Mayflower Hotel on the map did not reflect the true location of the one bedroom apartments We have stayed in Kensington before and managed to get a quiet room which served our needs well So it is possible  The apartment was very close to a Tube station and was clean well fitted out and newly renovated ,neutral
 I didn t receieved a key code then in order to access to the room I had to make international calling which cost me extra money The refrigeration didn t work and the table lamp didn t work as well  Good location double bed is very comfortable private and clean toilet and very good internet connection,neutral
 A glass door that doesn t lock in the bathroom is a terrible idea Everything seemed worn down And there was a lot of dust and unclean areas  The large bed was comfortable ,neutral
 Lights kept on going off In our room only Staff were rude My gf is Arabic and the maintenance man had to be in the room fixing wiring while she was in bed as we could not see anything  It was clean ,neutral
 awful room awful restaurant carvery ok staff not much only the location,neutral
 The service provided in this hotel was below my expectations One example I asked to the concierge to book a taxi yesterday morning Answer don t worry you don t need to book taxi there is a line in front of the hotel When I arrived no taxi was there I missed by train because I had to find one by my own Of course nobody was in front of the hotel or in the lobby to help me I am disappointed and will not come back No Positive,neutral
 They mention that there is a kitchen in the room but no pans and not allowed to cook Room for family very small no space to walk Very late checkin 16 00 early checkout at 11 00 and 10 euro per hour more if you want later checkout max till 14 00 hours costs 30 euro Small and old elevator small hallways not good if you are claustrophobic  Cleaness and location ,neutral
 Check in is inefficient and staff are not friendly  Location is great and convenient Room is spacious ,neutral
 There was no BBC news channel other than French spoken channel We reported to the staff that told us the engineer had checked our room We couldn t get BBC channel in our room because the location of our room The staff didn t think an alternative way to solve the problem which I found slightly disappointed I do stay in the Paris for holiday watching TV isn t a big issue however I do like to know what s going on in the world early in the morning before I get out of the door Especially all the disasters have happened in Paris recently I do recommend the hotel to solve the TV problem out for foreign travellers  The location is brilliant ,neutral

 No room service at all wont be staying there again  Very clean and spacious rooms ,neutral
 The whole hotel is very tired and needs to invest in some new furniture My bath was missing a tap cover dirty drain away and dirty soap dish Although the concierge was OTT welcoming when you arrived if you actually needed anything after that he really seemed very off No Positive,neutral
 Staff Location,neutral

 Breakfast Waited on pot of tea for 10 min had to re ask a second time Also butter for toast wasn t sitting out had to ask and it was in a closed cupboard No Positive,neutral
 On arrival I was given two vouchers for an evening meal as we were a running a little late in the day I thought this would be a good option to catch up on some time I called and booked a table for 18 00 thinking that 1 hr was ample time for dinner on entering the restaurant I made it clear that we had a show to attend and needed to be out of the restaurant by 19 00hrs and could we be quite hasty with the order We waited 10 minutes before our order was taken and the a further 25 minutes for our starter to arrive By the time the mains arrived we had no option but to rush our main course and skip having the dessert that we had paid for in the meal deal Breakfast was pretty poor for the standard of the hotel and the price we paid We waited 15 minutes for an offer of any hot drinks I approached a member of staff and requested a pot of tea for 2 and pointed out to where we were sitting I also asked if there was any salt and pepper as there was none on our table The lady was very pleasant and explained should deal with my request straight away We proceeded with collection of the breakfast items on show After a further 10 minutes with a cold breakfast in front ourselves A table of 4 was shown to their table not far from us and within a few seconds were propositioned as to what beverages they would like in the mean time we were still left with no tea or salt and pepper By the time I had got the jist of what was going on The gentleman supplying the beverages had turned around and walked off At this point I decided to hunt down the salt and pepper and my wife tracked down the person responsible to supply us with the drinks some 10 minutes later with my last fork full of breakfast in walks the lady with the items that I had originally requested The next morning at breakfast we were left hunting for cutlery and clean glasses for orange juice No Positive,neutral
 The bar on the ground floor had a sign saying closed and the roof top bar was open if you wanted a drink It was a bit cold in the evening to sit up there We had the sound of running water like a shower running all night Couldn t sleep Booked room with a terrace but no lighting out there so couldn t sit out in evening  Our room was very clean and the staff were friendly The arrival drink was a nice touch The location was good for our purpose ,neutral
 Jacuzzi not working small room apparently was going to be 5 stars  Saunas,neutral
 That you have to pay extra for a room with a view of the Thames  Good breakfast ,neutral
 We booked and paid for at the time of bokking a twin bedded room Upon arrival at the hotel we were told there was no twin bedded room available as we were the last to arrive what did that matter we had prepaid the room without cancellation we were told we had been given an upgrade room which was a joke it was so small as to be almost claustrophobic heaven help those who stay in ordinary room in my work I have travelled the world and this hotel room was the smaa lest I have had the misfortune to come across first time we have booked through booking com probably also the last No Positive,neutral

 This hotel has Aeropuerto in its name therefore mostly geared towards passengers arriving from a flight departing next morning or both Their airport shuttle should be the most important offering Instead if you book a stay at this hotel there is no guarantee you re getting a shuttle ride at all They run the shuttle from the hotel to the airport on a preset schedule with 45 minute intervals and there are only 8 seats per ride I would strongly suggest taking this into consideration before booking this hotel as this may screw up your plans very badly The hotel itself is in a middle of a industrial area not sure if you can get a taxi to pick you up from there Our reservation was breakfast included we came in and sat at a table The breakfast attendant asked us the room number which we thought was normal At the end without any explanation she handed us a bill for our breakfast which apparently we must pay now I pulled my smartphone showing our reservation on Booking com clearly stating that breakfast was included Instead she sent us to the receptionist to handle the bill situation At first the receptionist tried to convince me that breakfast was not included until I pulled my smartphone again then she clicked something on her computer and said it was ok and we did not have to pay for breakfast Breakfast area was not air conditioned hot and muggy the food choice was minimal and of poor quality Their only coffee machine was a hit or miss Had to complain it did not dispense hot water attendant came in and restarted the machine If you pressed Hot Chocolate you got Coffee If you re planning to use the indoor pool please remember that they require everyone to wear a swim cap  Very spacious two bedroom suite with the largest bathroom had a Jacuzzi shaped bathtub Very comfortable mattresses ,neutral

 The rooms our old and dated with stained carpeting There was only one hook to hang our wet towels after a shower concierge booked a trip to stone henge for us and the bus ended up dumping us off on the other side of the city where we had to pay 25 Euro to get back to our hotel I complained to the concierge and they said someone would contact me It has been almost a month and no one has  The staff was friendly and helpful The lobby was very nice and updated I also liked the location as it is walking distance to Starbucks and the British Museum,neutral
 There are no drawers or shelves in the room on which to place clothes etc for my 9 day stay though the hotel helped out by bringing some shelves I was surprised at the sudden hike in room charge for Friday Saturday even though I stayed for 9 days  Location breakfast general mood inside the hotel,neutral

 Reception desk consierge have not yet learned that they need to treat all clients alike Cleanness is a major Isuse Saturday 14 11 after repeated inquiries on my part they finally managed to perform the daily room cleaning at 14 30 The internet kept disconnecting for no apparent reason All the above and perhaps others that l may omitted justify the reduced numbers of guest at the hotel No Positive,neutral

 Very bad reception I arrived at the hotel at 9 am very tired from a very long trip Cambodia Thailand Paris I asked if I could have a room available for early check in Amandine at the reception said to me no room is available yet I told her that I have no choice than waiting at the lobby for the room and to be so kind to let me know if a room would be available before normal check in time She answerd me I can t inform you you just come back at 2 pm and that s it This way to answer is not acceptable In regards to the room it is acceptable but there is not enough light  Good Location just in front of Gare du Nord,neutral
 The bath towel was not new with multiple stains and strong smell of sweat I asked the reception to report why  Location,neutral

 There was no air conditioning had to move rooms 3 times untill 3 got a corner room with 3 windows This was ok if we left the windows open all day and night They were like sweat boxes The steam room and sauna were being cleaned serviced or not working twice in our 4 night stay This is barely a 4 hotel we stayed at olimpica suits 10 min walk away prior and that 4 hotel was incredible compared Way to expensive  The location was awesome and good breakfast but there was no air conditioning so sweating and no sleep through the night they said they only have cool air con from late May to save energy costs maybe they should charge less for the stay before May as we payed for an air con room which they don t have They told us too open the window Which resulted in mosquito bites The beach is literally 5 min walk away which was cool But this hotel is way over priced The staff were helpful and friendly and willing to help on our problems but ultimately I wouldn t stay here again Well not for this price ,neutral
 Impossible to use the Wi Fi ended up using my cell phone as a modem via 4G The room though very nice was above the Underground rails The racket from the trains was hardly bearable until about 01 00 a m even though we were on Floor 11 I can only guess what it might be like on lower floors  The location Friendliness of staff ,neutral
 The staff was extremely unfriendly impolite and could not not help me even with taxi proposing go on the street and check if there is one We came with 3 small children at 12 00 and reception refused to give us a room earlier than 14 00 which is official check in time saying if you want to check in earlier you should pay for the night before Finally I was charged additional 8 EUR for using internet which was a gesture of misery if you pay 350 EUR a night  The room was well furnished clean and comfortable ,neutral

 Hotel is very isolated unless the ferry to Canary Wharf works for you I chose the hotel because Booking com told me it was only a couple of miles from the venue in Wapping I was spending the evening at It didn t point out there was a bloody great river in the way and the taxi fare to get across was about 40 so the need to use bus and overground meant I had to leave before the end  Modern hotel nice view across the river to Canary Wharf although my room wasn t facing that way Warm cookie on check in although I had to remind the receptionist ,neutral

 Overall what we got was not what we expected from a four star hotel The hotel is quite old and the rooms are very small There s only one lift that takes ages to reach we sometimes had to use the stairs The lift itself is very small and can barely take 4 persons Breakfast however was our greatest disappointment We were offered continental breakfast with the room we took The breakfast area down the basement was quite dim and unwelcoming with dark antique furnishing Not the perfect atmosphere for your early morning breakfast the selection of food was very narrow Only one kind of cheese and no eggs There was no name tag under each dish we couldn t tell what type of meat was on the tray  Staff were very friendly always smiling and very helpful when asked for anything They changed the room the next day when we complained about how tiny our room was ,neutral

 The bed wobbled every time you moved The housekeeping does not replace the coffee coffee cups you have to pay to get extra after the first night No milk either The WIFI is totally useless it automatically disconnects every few minutes and is painfully slow You can t get a good night sleep as the black out curtains don t block out the sun completely and the housekeeping staff are very loud come 8am Very disappointing stay  The hotel was clean ,neutral

 Live in north west London booked for a romantic night close to the action Awful check in experience ruined our stay I had asked the hotel to allow my partner to check in as she was arriving before me via booking com unfortunately the gentleman on the desk couldn t help her he said he couldn t see the note fair enough but you have my card and you have me on the phone with the booking number etc it s a one night booking and you have the power to charge the card anyway as you would if I hadn t turned up I rushed from the other side of the city only to find my girlfriend sat in the lobby almost an hour later perhaps the hotel could have given her a tea or somewhere to change for our evening out When I talked to the lady who was now on the desk she was baffled as to why the person my partner had dealt with while I was also available on the phone had not just charged the card on file and let her into the room All together the knock on effect was that I had to conduct my business activities planned for Friday afternoon on Saturday meaning that we didn t get to enjoy the facilities we missed our evening reservation at a restaurant in Hoxton and my treat for my other half was essentially ruined by a lack of competency from the man on the front desk The hotel made absolutely no attempt to try to make things right You will see from my other reviews that I am balanced and fair in my feedback  The room was clean one of the cleanest I have ever seen and comfortable The Hotel s location is great ,neutral
 Rooms were very noisy and the atmosphere was very strangeNo Positive,neutral
 Although the staff were nice they screwed our meal orders up twice Our room was really nice the first night large room with a window We decided to come back and stay a second night but got put in a terrible room Very small the air conditioning didn t work so we had to open all the windows in the middle of winter to keep it cool There was a bank of about 50 air conditioning units right outside our window so it was super noisy The bathroom stunk of mold and Lynx deodorant The drains were blocked and the bed was terrible It was super hard and super creaky which woke us up a lot in the night Between the creaky bed and the air conditioning units outside the stuffy heat and the mouldy stench we didn t have a very good sleep at all I think maybe we stayed in an upgraded room the first night without knowing An upgrade was offered to us the second night for 20 pounds but we didn t think we needed it and assumed we d have a similar room as the previous night But we definitely didnt On a different topic the adult movie channel was terrible Super fetishy chin strap ons surgical instruments lots of pvc and horrible badly lit ugly people having gross sex Not my cup tea but if you re into that kind of stuff you ll love this place  The building is beautiful and well maintained great location easy to get around and great value compared to other hotels in the area Very grand and gothic love the links with the titanic too ,neutral

 The hotel is 3 5 km away from Stadio San Siro metro station There is no late night bus with the last bus dropping close to the hotel ending it s run at 8 PM on weekdays and no service on weekends or holidays The hotel s metro shuttle runs till 10 PM on prior booking Be careful if you rely on public transportation and will reach the hotel late as the approach road is deserted The wifi is open without a password or authentication Good if you just want to surf the net but if you plan to get some work done VPN requirements will block you  The room was well maintained and the breakfast was wholesome ,neutral

 Overall I had a terrible experience here as I had my purse stolen from the hotel reception while collecting my luggage There is no security whatsoever everyone can come in and out of the reception from the street and while the location is convenient close to the train station it is also one of the rougher areas of Paris so some form of security is a must Some ideas have someone supervising the door at the very least and a door that stays closed unless someone buzzes you in  The room was standard for a budget hotel ,neutral
 no free wi fi for a 5star hotel no soundproof rooms nor privacy location not bad clean and friendly staff,neutral
